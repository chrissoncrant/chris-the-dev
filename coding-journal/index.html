                    <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                    <p>Jumping back into Josh’s course. For now the plan is to spend at least an hour everyday on the course. Currently I am in module 3 which is about the basics of flexbox.</p>
                    
                    <p>I already am pretty familiar with flexbox so this module should go by quickly, however when I am already familiar with the main content, it is a perfect opportunity to become aware of more subtle concepts. So I will keep my eyes peeled. Plus, practice is practice. </p>
                    
                    <p>————————————</p>
                    
                    <p>Just had a discovery about how align-contents works. This has been a bit vague to me, mainly due to it not being relevant. However today I discovered one area where it comes into play.</p>
                    
                    <p>Usually a flex container’s height will be set based on its content. However if a flex container has a specific height set and the flex-direction is row with wrapping enabled, when the wrap becomes active, each flex child will fill out the space specified (we’re assuming no overflow happening). </p>
                    
                    <p>This specified space is the flex-child containment area, however, the actual element living within this containment, doesn’t necessarily have to fill this space. By default align-items is set to stretch, and so in the cross-axis the element is set to stretch the cross space of the containment. </p>
                    
                    <p>Changing align-items to say flex-start will make the element within the containment its natural size in the cross direction, and then move the element to the start of the containment cell itself. </p>
                    
                    <p>The key here is the containment cell in the cross direction is always taking up the full allotted space, which is determined by factors such as the height of the flex container and the content of the flex-children. It is the area within which the element can be placed.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now to change how the containment itself is laid out, we use align-content. Its default value is stretch. If we change this to flex-start, what this does is shrink down the containment to the size of the element itself, and moves them to the cross-axis start of the flex container. In a way, what this does is alters the flex-child containment size. </p>
                    
                    <p>When the flex-child containment size is no longer stretching, now align-items isn’t effective. </p>
                    
                    <p>Align-content shrinks the flex-child containments, which means that these containments can be moved within the flex-parent’s containment area. </p>
                    
                    <p>Align-content isn’t very useful if height is not specified on the flex-parent (assuming flex-direction being row).</p>
                    
                    <p>————————————</p>
                    <p>Another thing I learned: there is no justify-content: stretch. In order to have a flex-child stretch to fill in a horizontal direction is to switch the flex-direction altogether. Stretching only occur in the cross-axis direction, not the main axis. Good to know!</p>
                    
                    <p>————————————</p>
                    <p>Understanding Vertical-Align:</p>
                    <p>This declaration and its values still tend to confuse me, but I spent a little time today and I think I understand it more. Maybe.</p>
                    
                    <p>The variables:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>inline or inline-block items
                        </li>
                        <li>font-size of elements
                        </li>
                        <li>line-height
                        </li>
                        <li>baseline
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>With no line-height set, it will be set by the font-size and all inline elements will align on the baseline. </p>
                    
                    <p>The height of the containing block of all the inline elements (not necessarily the container, but the pseudo-inline container is determined by the height of the element with the largest font-size.</p>
                    
                    <p>This declaration is all about how the baseline of one inline elements relates to the baseline of others.</p>
                    
                    <p>How it works I am still a bit confused. Will continue with <a href="https://christopheraue.net/design/vertical-align" target="_blank">this article on how vertical-alignment works</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>I still get caught using “center” instead of “middle” with this damn declaration. </p>

                <h3>Organizing</h3>
                <p>Since I have completed the Space Tourism site I am now ready to retire my old 2011 MacBook Pro. I have this fancy new MBP that has patiently been waiting for its time in the sunshine.</p>
                
                <p>Today involves a lot of organizing and setting up. I made sure that I had everything I needed from the old Mac and made a list of what I need to do to get my new Mac ready.</p>
                
                <p>This mainly meant making a list of the important apps to install and the repos to clone in to the local machine. Alfred is the only app I really needed to download. It is a life saver. When other needs come up, that is when I will download those. </p>
                
                <p>I also took this time to revisit my current trajectory. These between project gaps can be dangerous. They are where momentum can die. Hence the planning.</p>
                
                <p>At this point I am ready to move on with Josh’s CSS course. I also have another, simpler, Front End Mentor project that I want to start, as well as a React Bootcamp course and to start on a Javascript course in Front End Masters. Now it is just a matter of scheduling this out.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Today is about finishing touches. Getting into the nitty gritty details.</p>
                
                <p>Already I made some adjustments to the grid layout of the crew page as I noticed things were a bit smooshed together. </p>
                
                <p>I used the Inspector to fine tune the grid and then set up more specified grid-template-column values to make it look much better. </p>
                
                <p>Also, solving small issues. Had to add color declaration to the large button because on my phone in Safari the color of the text was blue for some reason. </p>
                
                <p>Set up the Explore button functionality on the home page. I am not sure why this is made to be a button instead of just being a link because that is all it is. </p>
                
                <p>I added some visually hidden labels to the number indicators on the technology page. This initially broke the javascript, but I solved that easily enough. </p>
                
                <p>Watching some of the tutorial Kevin talked about progressively enhancing images by using the picture and the source element. This was cool as I hard coded in to use webp formatted images, but noticed on my older version of Safari that these weren’t showing up. Kevin’s talk solved this issue.</p>
                
                <p>I did have to go back through the javascript and update that so it dynamically loads the correct image into the correct place, but that wasn’t difficult at all. </p>
                
                <p>Next thing was to add alt attributes for all images and for this to update based on the image loaded. Again, this was simple. Had to update the object with the data, then set the attribute. Involved a few lines of code.</p>
                
                <p>Wrapped up the README for the project as well. I feel like I am ready to add it to the Front End mentor as complete to see what kinds of issues come up. </p>
                
                <p>Also, I checked on multiple devices and browsers and things seem to be working well.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>One of the things about learning something new, grid in this case, is the lack of consistency in implementation. This is par for the course. With less experience one is still finding methodologies and efficient patterns of operations. </p>
                
                <p>This website displays this. However, not that I am almost through with it I am finding that I would like more consistency throughout, especially with the components that are consistent throughout.</p>
                
                <p>What this means is I am going to rework the grid for the 2nd through 4th pages to make the page title and grid system more consistent.</p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                
                <p>Updating the grid system went easily enough. Now the page titles are consistent and the code itself is also more consistent.</p>
                
                <p>The next, and “last” thing to do is to set up the dynamic loading of content for the technology page.</p>
                
                <p>This is less straightforward than the other two in one way: there are two orientations for the images based on the viewport width. In desktop mode the image is to be in the portrait orientation. In all others it is to be landscape. </p>
                
                <p>I know what I am going to use to help me with this. It is the Media Query List API that I used for the smart focusing. I will use this to help me determine when to change the image out.</p>
                
                <p>The page loads initially with the landscape. That’s what’s in the initial HTML. When the script runs initially it will check to see if it is desktop mode, and if so it will perform the ol’ switcharoo on the image. </p>
                
                <p>Next I need to set up a listener so that images will be changed based on the media query. To do this I first had to check which button/tab is the active tab, which will allow me to select for the correct image. Then whenever the media query changes it will set the appropriate image.</p>
                
                <p>The last part is simply setting up the click listener for the tabs. I took advantage of the function I wrote for the media query event listener function and just ran that again based on the button selection. </p>
                
                <p>With this in place, everything is now working! Well… except the main Explore button on the first page. This button seems a little tricky in that it is really a link, not a button. It leads to the Destinations page. I am curious to see how to make this function on the backend with JavaScript. </p>
                
                <h3 id="Building: Fluid Type Calculator">Building: Fluid Type Calculator</h3>
                <p>I decided to whip up a quick and functional Fluid Type calculator, improving upon what I made yesterday by adding the html and some simple styling. It works and it did not take too long to put together. I am sure there are calculators out there already that I could have found, but damnit I like mine. </p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>

                <p>Well today went by pretty fast. Getting much quicker in decision making and the process itself is just moving faster. This is because I don’t have to think about as much for each of the next pages. It’s a cool momentum.</p>
                
                <p>I do believe that it is only by gaining enough of this kind of momentum that the more subtler and more exciting patterns start to emerge as far as seeing consistencies and getting a better feel for when something can be done more efficiently even if the how to do so isn’t there yet. Just that sense is a good thing.</p>
                
                <p>I got the last page of the site built up. It’s funny because when I started this project I was feeling such an overwhelm, but now it seems so straightforward on what to do and how to do. I am actually quite amazed at how much I did learn while putting this together. Seeing the mountain, feeling intimidated by it, taking it step by step and here I am damn near on the other side. </p>
                
                <p>Today’s challenge had to do with getting more familiar with grid and how it works and how I am really starting to like it. I like grid-template-areas and how they work.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Hitting a bit of a rhythm here. The crew page which is designed a bit differently got put together today.</p>
                
                <p>I implement grid-template areas to style the desktop version as I really like how that worked when watching Kevin’s tutorial.</p>
                
                <p>I implemented the JS dynamic loading of content similar to what I did on destinations page. </p>
                
                <p>I did run into a bit of a puzzle regarding this, which I mentioned last night. I solved the problem by simply putting all the text in the h2 element into spans that way I could grab them separately using data-element attributes and add the content.</p>
                
                <p>The next challenge was simply getting the image to sit the way the design has it and fix certain issues that occur at the edge case of the smallest desktop size. I implemented the clamp values and my handy clamp value calculator to create smoothly resizing type that fits and fills the screen nicely. </p>
                
                <p>Got started on the Technology page.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>I rebuilt the destinations page following Kevin’s tutorial. It went well. I am keeping the one I built, but I like how he implemented the grid template area property and will be doing that for the crew page.</p>
                
                <p>I made a good start on the crew mobile page. Started programming the dynamic filling script for the content. This was a little more challenging because there is a nested span in a header. </p>
                
                <p>The problem with this is setting the textContent to an element replaces everything within it. Also I do not want to use innerHTML if I don’t have to. What I found was the ability to create a textNode as well as an element and so with this I think I can make it work.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Yesterday I fixed up the focus styling for the tabs on the destinations page of the space tourism website. Thanks to the study I did 2 days ago I knew exactly what I had to do. No guesswork.</p>
                
                <p>Today I will get the destinations page functional for across all sizes.</p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                
                <p>The first issue I ran into was text overflowing the provided grid size at the minimum point for the desktop view.</p>
                
                <p>To solve this I first had to determine why the text was overflowing. This was layered. The first layer involves the allotted container space. The size of the width of the content columns is the viewport width - (the size of the padding + the minimum size of the first and last columns + the 3 gap sizes), all divided by two. </p>
                
                <p>Calculating this wasn’t necessary per say, but helped to pinpoint why the content columns were fixed at the size they were fixed at.</p>
                
                <p>Next I had to find what element within the overflowing column was causing the overflow. I used Dev Tools for this and found it had to do with the inner-column header as well as the tab gap sizes. </p>
                
                <p>I decided to solve this I would use the CSS clamp function.</p>
                
                <p>In order to use the clamp functioning precisely required me to identify first what values I would be clamping (gap size and header size), then identify the minimum font size and gap size at the desktop breakpoint that reduce/eliminate the overflow.</p>
                
                <p>For the header’s minimum font size I went to the header that was the longest then started reducing the font size in the inspector until it was below the width of the grid column. I then adjusted the gap size similarly.</p>
                
                <p>The initial sizes set by the design spec were to be the max font and gap sizes. </p>
                
                <p>Next I found the minimum viewport width size needed for the initial overflow to fit properly. </p>
                
                <p>With all these values I was able to calculate the clamp value needed. </p>
                
                <p>Awhile I ago I spent some time going through this article on how the clamp function works and how to get the correct values necessary. I was glad I created a note summarizing the formulas because I didn’t want to read it again. </p>
                
                <p>Because the formulas are a bit involved I decided to create the start of another reference project that would help me get the correct clamp value to copy and paste into my CSS.</p>
                
                <p>This evolved into creating a simple JS function that took in the necessary inputs and outputted the clamp value. I also coded in the option to have the output be in pixels or rems. The output is the full clamp string that can be copied and pasted as a value in the stylesheet. In the future I will make this into a legitimate tool. For now it is just JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>——————————</p>
                <p>The styling for the Destinations page is completed. I am debating whether I will watch Kevin’s tutorial for this or not. </p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Phase two of yesterday’s goals commences today: The link and focus styling analysis.</p>
                
                <p>What I learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>:focus styling a link requires it being in the right order of the other link pseudo-classes.
                        LVFHA. A nice mnemonic for this: LoVe Fears HAte (it’s so precious)
                    </li>
                    <li>If :focus is styled, but no outline declaration is specified within the rule, then the default
                        styling supplied by the browser will be applied in addition to the styles declarations within
                        the rule.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the :focus pseudo class is used, then it will behave a bit differently than the default
                        browser focus styling for links and buttons. The default styling doesn’t style buttons and links
                        that are clicked on with the mouse. The styling only applies to items focused on via the
                        keyboard. With :focus, this changes. The :focus styling will apply to clicked buttons and links
                        and will remain that way until the page is clicked elsewhere. This may not be desirable
                        behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>Styling using :focus-visible seems to behave like the default styling in that the styling will
                        only be applied when the item is focused on via keyboard commands. The styling remains even when
                        the focused on item is click or entered.
                    </li>
                    <li>The ordering of :focus and :focus-visible matters. It works with the cascade. Later styles will
                        overwrite earlier ones.
                    </li>
                    <li>The :active link pseudo class is a momentary styling and is not useful for indicating a
                        currently selected tab.
                    </li>
                    <li>The :target class is pretty neat in that it is a way to style popups and tooltips.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>With all this mind it is time to apply these learnings to the Space Tourism site.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Starting to feel that this project is dragging a bit. Yet, I feel I have learned a lot in that dragging. A lot has been captured in the dragnet, so to speak. I’ve learned a lot about accessibility and focusability. I learned a lot about JavaScript and its APIs like Proxy Objects, Custom Elements, Media Query Lists, as well as classes and objects.</p>
                
                <p>I also learned that building design systems isn’t helpful until one has a certain vocabulary of building without them. This Space Tourism website has shown me what I already knew: following tutorials is not a good way to learn in general, but is nice for gathering tricks from more those more experienced. </p>
                
                <p>I have a couple goals for today: learn more about the difference between the focus and focus-visible pseudo classes as well as those of links and how all of these are related to one another. The other goal is to get the rest of the Javascript working to dynamically fill the destinations page. If I accomplish both of those goals, then this destinations page will be completed and there will only be two more pages left.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Phase One complete (which is actually goal 2 of the above paragraph… typical). The JavaScript is functioning and filling in the appropriate information. I remember when this was more difficult, but now certain things seem so much more obvious. With that said, giggles of joy arose with each correctly functioning button press. I am the rat and these buttons are releasing chemicals of pleasure. Press, press, press, press, press.</p>
                
                <p>The whole process is “simply” this: collect the information needed within JS objects, then collect each of the objects within an array. Arrays are nice because they have all those fancy methods and are easier to iterate through. Or at least that’s my thoughts at the moment. Already feeling second guesses at such a statement. But we will continue on.</p>
                
                <p>Next up, gather the button elements that will be needed. These buttons are the triggers. These triggers will initiate the action of updating the information on the page with that collected in the destination objects. </p>
                
                <p>With these collected it is time to add the event listener to each of the buttons. At this point I realize it would be nice to have a check to make sure that the button that is clicked is not associated with the information already loaded/displayed on the page itself.</p>
                
                <p>To do this I created (I realize I am bouncing around in tense, for that I apologize) a variable wired up to the first button element in the collection of the buttons I gathered earlier. I wired it up to the first simply because this is the initial information that the page will load with. </p>
                
                <p>With that done I set up a simple check to make sure that the button clicked is not the currently selected destination. If it is, well, click away my fine fellow, but nothing will happen. The action wired up to the click will simply return. However, if it is in fact different, then that’s when the fun begins. Oh yes. </p>
                
                <p>The first thing that is done is a state change. This occurs by updating the value of the aria-selected attributes of the selected destination and the, what is now, previously selected destination. This will update the styles accordingly.</p>
                
                <p>With that done, the correct destinations object is filtered out of the destinations array. This is done by grabbing the text content of the button itself which is the name of the destination. </p>
                
                <p>Next, each of the elements that need updating (title, summary, and stats) is wired up to a variable, then updated based on the values of the properties of the destination object. It is that easy.</p>
                
                <p>I love that I can now say that it is that easy. However, I know that that there is still a whole lot to learn (understatement) and I am sure the process I have implemented can be greatly improved upon with more experience. I am not cocky. Just grateful for progress and, more so, for the revelation of it.</p>
                
                <p>Phase Two will have to wait until tomorrow.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Last night was a brutal night of no sleep. Energy was extremely low today. Eventually I set myself in front of the computer. The hardest part is pushing through the borderlands of inertia. Once I get going then going becomes easier.</p>
                
                <p>I managed to get the destinations page styled up pretty quickly and easily, though I feel the CSS is a bit messy. I would like to rebuild this site again from the ground up and see if I can make it more orderly. With that said things are working and it looks good.</p>
                
                <p>I am not going to have individual pages for the 4 destinations, but am setting it up so the content changes based on the button that is clicked. I set up the “hard” part in the JavaScript file. I created an array of the objects with the necessary data to be loaded in.</p>
                
                <p>Upon clicking one of the destination tab buttons, there is a check against the initial destination that was loaded on the page. If the destination is different then the aria-selected attribute is updated, which updates the styling of the tab.</p>
                
                <p>The appropriate destination object is wired up to a variable. Next all I have to do is simply update the text content of the title, summary, and stats. Easy peasy. </p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>I created a new focus management system. This may not be as efficient as Andy Bell’s, but I am happy with it. It presented me with a challenge that I was able to solve. I tested it thoroughly and it is currently working quite nicely.</p>
                
                <p>Creating this made me think more about actions and triggers more deeply and how those are related to state and how state is what informs what specific action need to take place. </p>
                
                <p>Along with this I spent some time thinking about the progression from pseudo-code to actual code by identifying the triggers and the related actions that need to occur based on the state. </p>
                
                <p>There is a logical flow to this. Writing out the pseudo code puts into basic terms what needs to be accomplished. Identifying the triggers that initiates the actions moves us closer to the code itself. </p>
                
                <p>Trigger —> check current state (if necessary) —> perform actions —> update state (if necessary)</p>
                
                <p>All actions on the internet can be abstracted out to the above flow. </p>

                <p>Moving ahead with watching the tutorial. Got to the point where Kevin goes over his solution to the decorative horizontal line. His solution is neat and I like it, but I am sticking with mine. </p>
                
                <p>How he got his to work is by using a pseudo-element, which is what I wanted to use. He also utilized the order property to set where the line sits. I’ve never encountered this property before so it served as a good introduction to it. </p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                <p>The home page is now finished. Took way longer than I wanted, but this also has to do with me learning about a number of things, burger menu creation by way of Andy Bell’s tutorial being the biggest. I am moving forward with what I created while following with Kevin’s tutorial, though I am adding an additional aspect that combines both Andy’s and Kevin’s approach. </p>
                
                <p>Right now the focusable items remain focusable no matter if the menu is open or closed. The behavior I want for this is for links within the burger menu to only be focusable when the links are visible. </p>
                
                <p>The behavior will be implemented by way of using the tabindex=-1 declaration. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>I discovered the the mediaWatch method on the window object. This takes in a a media query string to check for. If I am within a certain media query I can trigger the changes I need. I can also add a ‘change’ event listener.</p>
                
                <p>This is the next step in the game.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Continuing with the walk-through of the homepage. We (yes, I have a mouse in my pocket) are now at the burger menu. One thing about Kevin’s tutorials that I like and dislike is his encouragement to do stuff on my own first. </p>
                
                <p>What I don’t like about this is it seems like a cop out for him. It means he doesn’t have to do the work. Like “Hey do this yourself because its good for you” and behind the scenes is this justification for laziness on his part for not actually doing the work and showing us what he would do. This defeats the purpose of the tutorial. Sure cheaters will cheat and they only cheat themselves., but should the one’s who don’t cheat be punished? That seems ridiculous. To me. </p>
                
                <p>What I like is that it’s important to not simply follow tutorials, but work stuff out for one’s self. I get this. It is inherent within me. I do this automatically. This is why I get annoyed when he doesn’t do something and uses the excuse that it’s good for me. I know it’s good for me, but at this point I want to see what you would do because that would be good for me too damnit.</p>
                
                <p>With that said, I did code the burger menu up using Javascript and have it functioning in a. Way that is pleasing to me and it took, maybe 10 mins. Now I will watch how he did it and code along if I feel it is necessary.</p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                
                <p>I liked how he did it. He utilized data attributes. This made for simpler code ultimately. He challenged us to change the icon and set up the animation. I did this, then watched how he did it. </p>
                
                <p>Again, he utilized the aria-expanded attribute to change the background-image in CSS. I am not sure if there is an advantage to doing it this way, but I think I like it better.  </p>
                
                <p>There seems to be a sense of separation of concerns. The JavaScript updates the attributes based on state, then within the CSS data-attribute selectors are used to update the styles. It keeps styling within the styles sheet and keeps the updating of attributes which control the styling within the JS. I loik it. I loik it a lot.</p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                <p>Good progress in styling the homepage and making it responsive. My favorite part was solving a tricky design dilemma. This highlights the gap between designer and developer. It’s so easy to just place a design element like a line within a graphics program, yet when it comes time to actually implement it in code, it is not so easy.</p>
                
                <p>I enjoyed mulling over different ways to save this dilemma where a horizontal line was added between the logo and the navigation. Logo and navigation lived on either side of the viewport, but between these there is a horizontal line that only serves a stylistic purpose. </p>
                
                <p>At first it tied using a pseudo element because these are not part of the HTML markup and so don’t gum up the works for screen readers, but I just couldn’t get it working in a way that was reliable between different screen sizes. I needed the line to be anchored on the left and on the right, but in a way where it could grow and shrink.</p>
                
                <p>The solution that came to mind was adding a spacer div to the markup and then taking advantage of the display flex set on the header, then simply setting flex-grow to 1 on this spacer element. I then just gave it a height of 2 px with a background-color and set the inline margins so they worked appropriately. This worked awesomely. I have yet to see how Kevin solved this problem, but I am looking forward to it. I feel very pleased with my solution and it is a sort of marker for growth in skills and knowledge.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Since I completed the home page I decided to watch the tutorial up to where I am. </p>
                
                <p>I created a new branch and deleted everything that I had to start from scratch. </p>
                
                <p>Kevin used grid in order to structure the content, which was good for me as it has been awhile since I used grid. </p>
                
                <p>One strategy that Kevin mentioned really intrigues me and I want to explore further. He mentioned how he styles from mobile first, but he builds the HTML from the desktop version first. This makes sense as the HTML structure for the desktop version is generally more complicated and so setting this structure up beforehand can make it easier. </p>
                
                <p>Kevin made use of the min and max functions, which I encountered before, but haven’t used much, so this was good.</p>
                
                <p>I am feeling a bit tangled up in the CSS and I am not sure I like the whole initial design system that was created. Creating things outside the actual website can make things more tedious. I am appreciative of this experience though as it reveals the importance of balance. </p>
                
                <p>Most of the challenges Kevin presented I either already completed or was able to complete. </p>
                
                <p>Ended at the functionality of the Burger menu button. I am looking forward to going through this tomorrow to see how he does it. </p>

                <p>Okay, it is finally time to start filling in the easy markup of the homepage, now that I have gotten the burger menu implemented and in a way that makes me feel proud. Good habits are being built. These good habits consist of the principles and mental models of progressive enhancement and accessibility. </p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                
                <p>I got the homepage styled easy enough, but then I encountered an issue where the navigation, when display, is underneath the main button in the body of the page. I can fix it easy enough by applying z-indexes to the navigation elements, however, I am not quite understanding what is happening, in regards to stacking contexts. A weakness has been revealed, so I am taking some time to understand what the heck is going on in order to make a more informed decision about how to tackle this. </p>
                
                <p>I solved this issue after committing to the fact that the body is going to be the parent of the absolutely positioned navigation panel. Therefore, anything that comes after the navigation panel that is positioned will lay on top of the navigation unless the stacking order is changed. </p>
                
                <p>In this case the main button itself is on the default stacking layer and is on top of the navigation due to the button coming after the navigation. I updated the z-index of the navigation to be 1, which required me to update the z-index of the button to 2. I will find out if this will cause issues later. For now, the homepage is complete.</p>

                <h3>Building: Rebuilding the Burger Menu and Applying It to the Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>The more I try to rebuild this thing from the scratch the more I reveal the aspects of the JS function I don’t understand. </p>
                
                <p>I have learned a lot about scope doing this. There are some places where a variable is wired up, but in other places a property is wired up using ‘this’ keyword. I realize that the places where a variable is used are those where the variable is only used within the scope of that specific method. When the property is created it is because this property will need to be accessed elsewhere and sometimes this is outside of the current method’s scope. </p>
                
                <p>I also learned about the ‘this’ keyword. There is a specific place where a variable is created that is wired up to ‘this’. Then within this same method (this is the constructor method), the proxy object is created. Within the handler of the proxy object a method that is defined on the main object is called using the variable tied to the main object. In this scope, the ‘this’ keyword is referencing the proxy object and not the main object which has the method that is needed to be called. By wiring up the main object to a variable it gives access to the required method.</p>
                
                <p>I am noticing that there is still too much gray/unknown/lack of clarity in my mind between the actions that need to be done on the front-end with the JS code behind the scenes. The code itself is really neat, but it serves a purpose, and I could memorize the code, but that would be pointless and a waste of time. Memorizing is generally a waste of time. What we need to remember is remembered due to utility. Establishing the connection between the code written and its purpose generates memorization as a byproduct. </p>
                
                <p>I believe that this idea reveals the purpose of pseudo-code.</p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                
                <p>I completed the burger-menu rebuild and then added the burger menu functionality and adapted styling to the Space Tourism website. The more I build it out, the more I understand. With that said it is time to move on. Perhaps I will build it again in a couple days. We shall see. Looking forward to progressing and finishing this Space Tourism site.</p>

                <h3>Building: Rebuilding the Burger Menu</h3>
                <p>The first phase of this day is rebuilding the burger menu from scratch and as best as I can from memory. </p>
                
                <p>While going along I have been writing about what I am doing to reinforce the purpose of each move. This is helping me better grasp all the layers that are occurring within this project.</p>
                
                <p>This project is so juicy because it consists of so many layers. There’s a lot of accessibility happening with aria attributes and focusability adjustment depending on state. There is the progressive enhancement aspect that allows for a great user experience even without JS enabled. This progressive enhancement also means that if JS is disabled, there isn’t unnecessary markup muddying up the experience. </p>
                
                <p>The more time I spend in the land of Andy Bell’s burger menu, the more I glean. I am being greedy here. I want to suck up every bit of knowledge I can. I realize that there is a threshold where the gains will start to diminish, but I am not there yet. </p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism</h3>
                <p>Alrighty! Back to the Space Tourism website. I am excited to apply what I learned over the last few days to building out the hamburger menu on this page. </p>
                
                <p>Okay, so I had to sort of relearn what the heck was happening in the Design System that was created. As I was coding the homepage I realized that some wackiness was happening within the CSS in regards to focus behavior.</p>
                
                <p>I am not pushing blame on anyone, but I found it interesting that while following along with Kevin he set focus behavior on a list item. I didn’t think anything of it while following along, but now, due to my burger menu adventure, I am much more familiar with focus behavior. This caused me to use the tab key and that’s when I discovered the problem. </p>
                
                <p>First, the styling was not working as expected. This was because the list item doesn’t get focused, the link gets focus. To make the list item have focus we would need to add the “tabindex=0” to the list item. However, what would be the point of doing that? That would add an unnecessary layer for keyboard users to get to the actual link! Not a good UI. </p>
                
                <p>So I went on another side adventure in styling up focus. I learned about using box-shadow. I learned about the potential issue of using border in that it causes things to shift around. I also learned that outline seems to now follow along with border-radius. I am not so sure if this is true, but my experiments show it to be.</p>
                
                <p>The next phase was applying what I learned to the CSS I already have implemented for the Space Tourism website. It wasn’t too difficult to do this. Just had to move a selector down (or up?) the rung. </p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                <p>With the basic styling in place it was time to start applying the fancy schmancy burger menu to this project. This was another opportunity to reinforce my learnings.</p>
                
                <p>I began by going off my memory. This was helpful in revealing the parts I still did not comprehend. I think I am going to do this many more times over the next few weeks. I believe many important concepts and patterns of thinking will be reinforced by doing so. </p>
                
                <p>I got the burger menu code coded up. The next phase is styling it up. I am excited to be implementing this feature into this project.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Burger Menu</h3>

                <h4>Summary of the Burger project and the JavaScript</h4>
                <p>Had a nice Sunday off yesterday. Days off are good. No coding was done, yet at the same time I know that some behind-the-scenes processing was taking place. </p>
                
                <p>Today I continue with this Burger Menu. I had no idea that it would turn out to be a multi-day side-adventure, but I already feel I know so much more about JavaScript and other specialized APIs such as Resize Observer, Custom Elements, and Proxy objects. I also have learned a lot about state and its use. This will definitely come handy when I start learning React. </p>
                
                <p>A sloppy summary of this Burger Menu:</p>
                
                <p>We have a button. The good ol’ burger button that we are all familiar with.  When the screen is at a certain size it appears and the navigation goes away, and vice versa.</p>
                
                <p>When the button is present, it has a basic functionality of revealing and concealing the navigation. </p>
                
                <p>These are the two visibility concerns. </p>
                
                <p>Then there is the case of focusability. When the button is not showing, we want links to be focusable as they naturally would be. When the button is showing and the menu is closed, we don’t want the links to be focusable. When it is open we do. </p>
                
                <p>These are the conditions that the Burger Menu JS works with. Another word for these conditions is “state”. </p>
                
                <p>Between the user interaction and the resulting changes in the HTML is a state-controlling object. There are two states that need to be controlled: “status” and “enabled”.</p>
                
                <p>The “status” state relates to whether or not the menu is open or closed. This state is only relevant when the button itself is visible.</p>
                
                <p>The “enabled” state relates to whether the button itself is visible. If it is visible, then the “status” state becomes relevant. If it is not visible, then the button is unclickable and so the “status” state is irrelevant.</p>
                
                <p>The initial loading of the page triggers the script to run and set the initial states. The window width will determine the visibility of the button. If the button is initially visible, the menu will be closed (“status” = ‘closed’).</p>
                
                <p>At this point the user can resize the window or click the button and it is these two actions that cause changes to the state object. The state object itself has a handler that will trigger changes in the HTML (attribute values and focusability).</p>
                
                <p>User interactions change the state object, which triggers changes in the HTML. The state object is like a controlling buffer. </p>
                
                <p>The state object is necessary for memory. In order for a thing to open, it must somehow know that it is closed. In order for a thing to be set to be focusable or not, it must know what its surroundings are like. The state object is what conveys this information.</p>
                
                <p>It’s extremely nifty.</p>
                
                <h4>Styling the Burger Menu</h4>
                <p>I completed the styling and there are some very cool things happening here.</p>
                
                <p>Here’s a link to the final project: <a href="https://chrissoncrant.github.io/reference-projects/hamburger-menu/" target="_blank">Hamburger Menu</a></p>
                
                <p>The intricacies of the CSS are definitely worth analyzing further, but not here… at least for now. </p>
                
                <p>A quick summary though:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigation menu is set to fill entire screen
                    </li>
                    <li>Nifty creation of the burger icon using CSS and pseudo-elements
                    </li>
                    <li>Cool animation of the burger icon to an X and back.
                    </li>
                    <li>Learned about delay time values for the transition property.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cool subtle animation on the menu items when they appear.
                    </li>
                    <li>Awesome utilization of state-related HTML attributes to control CSS.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Learning: Andy Bell Tutorial on Global State System</h3>
                <p>I followed this <a href="https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-light-and-global-state-system/" target="_blank">Andy Bell tutorial on creating a global state system</a> which helped me grow even more familiar with the concept of state, how it works, and how Proxy object are very useful for doing do.</p>
                
                <p>I created a reference project for this, commenting it out to help with my current and future understanding of what the hell it is doing, and added it to my growing list of reference projects.</p>
                
                <p>I feel that I have learned so much practical JS over the course of analyzing the burger menu’s JS and this JS. I am looking forward to seeing how to implement it in the Space Tourism project, which I am about to get into next.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Burger Menu JavaScript</h3>
                <p>I am continuing analyzing the burger-menu JavaScript. I do this by commenting each method and each statement within the methods. </p>
                
                <p>I reorganized the class’ methods to better represent the flow. I am now so much more familiar with this class and how its pieces work.</p>
                
                <p>I am seeing now how cool custom elements are. The API for customElements gives access to the connectedCallback, which is called whenever the connected HTML custom element is added to the DOM. </p>
                
                <p>One thing that really helped in growing my understanding was taking a step back and examine what actions I want the code to take. Going back up to pseudo-code level.</p>
                
                <p>This is where I saw how the burger button’s visibility and the navigation was dependent up the width. I saw how in addition to this, once the button is visible the navigation’s visibility is controlled by the button clicks. </p>
                
                <p>That’s two actions there. The burger buttons visibility is related to the “enabled” attribute and the burger button’s ability to alter the visibility of the navigation is related to the “status” attribute.</p>
                
                <p>These attributes connect to CSS as well, as that’s where visibility will ultimately be altered. </p>
                
                <p>Behind the scenes there is an object that essentially keeps track of where everything is at was for incoming write operations to make the appropriate adjustments. This is the State object. </p>
                
                <p>When a user resizes or clicks the button, some JavaScript is triggered, which updates the State object, which triggers other functions to adjust certain behaviors and update certain HTML attribute values, which in turn alters what CSS is applied to the element. </p>
                
                <p>That’s basically what happens. But it’s quite a chunk of code that makes it happen.</p>
                
                <p>Speaking of CSS, I began playing around with the attributes and made some rules to define the button’s visibility and the menus visibility. </p>
                
                <p>I think tomorrow, or Monday I will be able to move forward from this awesome side adventure and start on the space-tourism website. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Proxy Objects</h3>
                <p>Continuing with he Hamburger Menu javascript function, I am led to Proxy objects. I had no idea what these were or how they worked. I now know much more, not only about these special objects, but also about what getters and setters are in general.</p>
                
                <p>Proxy objects are, to me, like secretary objects. They are a layer between the object and the outside world. Almost like how an API endpoint is between the data and the request being made. Proxy objects wrap the “target” object and any calls made to the proxy will go through the specified handler object. </p>
                
                <p>There are many methods that can be specified on the handler object. The most used are probably the getters and setters. Whenever a read request is made to the proxy object, they will be “intercepted” within the get “trap”. Whenever a write request is made on the proxy object these will be intercepted by the set trap. </p>
                
                <p><a href="https://javascript.info/proxy" target="_blank">This resource on proxy objects</a> was helpful for my understanding.</p>
                
                <p>I created a reference project for proxy objects as well.</p>
                
                <p>I limited my dive into this potential rabbit hole via how the Proxy element was being used within the Burger menu code. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Burger Menu JavaScript</h3>
                <p>With my newfound knowledge and began going through the huge custom element class and all of its methods, commenting out what each method and property is doing and how they are all tied together. This has been an enlightening experience. I feel like I have learned so very much. Form doing this. </p>
                
                <p>Based on my commenting I now know how the Resize Observer is being used and how it works. Instead of using media queries, this Resize Observer is determining whether or not to display the burger menu button based on the size of the <p> <code class='code-inline'>&lt;burger-menu&gt;</code> </p>custom element’s parent’s width when compared to the ‘max-width’ attribute’s value that is set on the burger-menu element. </p>

                <h3>Learning: JavaScript Classes</h3>
                <p>Today I thought I’d take apart that crazy class that was coded yesterday from  <a href="https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/" target="_blank">Andy Bell’s Hamburger Menu tutorial</a>. I started reading through the code noting what I needed to learn. This started off with classes in general.</p>
                
                <p>I started reading through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes" target="_blank">MDN’s article on JavaScript classes</a> while creating my own examples. This will end up being a reference project about classes. </p>
                
                <p>There is still quite a lot that goes over my head (binding, species, mix-ins), but that is simply par for the course. Without a real life need for it, there really is no need to worry about not quite “getting it.” Plus I know from experience, this brush with those concepts will make it easier to get once I encounter those things in the wild.</p>
                
                <p>I do now have a much better understanding of what the hell a class is (a special function which is essentially an object creator/factory that uses specialized sugary syntax that is a part of ES6, which improves upon the syntax needed to do the same thing with ES5), what a getter is and how it works, what extending a class does and what the super() function is.</p>
                
                <p>The next thing to explore is the Custom Elements and how they work in relation to extending them from the HTMLElement object, which is what is being done in the Hamburger Menu code. </p>
                
                <h2>Learning: Custom Elements</h2>
                <p>Dove into the MDN article on Custom Elements. Learned about how these work and how, for the most part, in order to take advantage of the built-in methods and properties of elements, these will want to be tied to the existing elements. This involves JavaScript and utilizing classes to extend the current objects, HTMLElement being the focus of my current circumstance.</p>
                
                <p>I created a little not for myself for a blog article to write about how to see the benefits of doing so. This article would highlight the usefulness of console.dir(), which displays all the properties of the object argument, both own and inherited. I did not know about console.dir() until I googled how to see inherited properties of an object.</p>
                
                <p>I also learned about how the lifecycle callbacks work and what they are for. Currently, the only one that is relevant is the connectedCallback(), as that’s what is used in the Hamburger Menu  in Andy Bell’s tutorial (link above). </p>
                
                <p>I also took a bit of a dive into what the Shadow DOM is as each of the articles I read which had to do with Custom Elements mentioned the Shadow Dom. It’s definitely a cool thing. Perhaps even as cool as it sounds… depends on who you talk to. Anything with “Shadow” appended to it instantly is cooler. For example: Shadow muffin. </p>
                
                <p>After today’s learnings the fancy JS from Andy’s tutorial is definitely making a whole lot more sense to me. I can actually read it quite clearly. Tomorrow I will begin looking into Proxy objects. I think it will take a bit more time for that concept to sink in, an</p>

                <h3>Learning: Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The goal is to start and finish the Space Tourism website project from Frontend Mentor. While starting on the home page I realized this was a really good opportunity to start applying some accessibility principles. </p>
                
                <p>I began today starting to read through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility" target="_blank">MDN’s What is Accessibility? article</a>. This was helpful because my understanding of who the audience of accessible website is for was foggy. Now I understand much more clearly the impairments accessible website are designed to work with.</p>
                
                <p>As a web developer, I want accessibility to be a fundamental priority and basis for how I work. I believe, strongly, that sites that are designed with accessibility in mind are not hamstrung by these limits, but are made more robust, functionally and even aesthetically. </p>
                
                <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility#element_relationships_and_context" target="_blank">This MDN article on handling common accessibility problems</a> was also an insightful read. It provided information on common pitfalls and how to correct them and also provided a lot of tools for testing accessibility. </p>
                
                <p>While reading these I also learned the context of WAI-ARIA attributes and what purpose they serve. Oftentimes as a web designer and developer the standard HTML elements that come with their own styling just won’t do. In these cases where custom components are needed, the same accessibility as would be provided by the semantic HTML element can be added using WAI-ARIA. This is cool!</p>
                
                <h2>Building: Space Tourism Site</h2>
                <p>I am going to finish up the hamburger menu tutorial from Andy Bell, which I started a few nights ago. Once I have this down I can code the hamburger menu of the home page as well as the rest of the home page. </p>
                
                <h2>Learning: Hamburger Menu Tutorial</h2>
                <p>Holy freakin’ smokes. Was cruising along with <a href="https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/" target="_blank">Andy Bell’s Hamburger Menu tutorial</a> and then I got to the JavaScript. This made y head explode a bit. But in a good way.</p>
                
                <p>He is using object orienting programming and constructed a class that has built within it several neat pieces of code using lots of things I am as of now unfamiliar with. </p>
                
                <p>The things: custom elements utilizing the Lifecycle callbacks, and extending them from the HTMLElement object, class syntax (though I do have a bit of experience with this), getters, Proxy objects, lots and lots of usage of the ‘this’ keyword, ResizeObserver API…</p>
                
                <p>There’s a lot going on. But I love how over my head this feels. It is meaty, juicy, good soil for lots of learning.</p>
                
                <p>Just writing out the code was a good practice. Every step of the way I was thinking about what this line was doing and how it related to the grand scheme. No mindless copying. </p>
                
                <p>Once I got it written, then, of course, it didn’t work right. But this was only another golden opportunity to troubleshoot. Dev Tools and console.log to the rescue. Troubleshooting this got me more familiar with the object and its intricacies. I solved the issue I was facing, but now I am faced with a new one that I am going to be saving for tomorrow to tackle. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>The calc() function is interesting. It was confusing to me at first how to apply units. For example if I wanted to convert 3px to rems I know I would divide 3 by 16, which give 0.1875 and I can apply ‘rems’ unit to that. But what if I wanted to use the calc function? How would I apply the rem units?</p>
                
                <p>Well, it would look like this: <code class='code-inline'>font-size: calc(3rem / 16);</code></p>
                
                <p>This would essentially give me 0.1875rems.</p>
                
                <p>But at a glance it can be confusing. What this calc function is not doing is first calculating what 3rems is and then dividing by 16, which would give 3rems as the result. What it is doing is calculating what 3 / 16 is, then applying the rem unit to the answer. </p>
                
                <p>This is a syntactical behavior of the calc function. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Finishing up the Icon Input challenge today. I have already created my own version of it using vanilla CSS. I am now watching the video to see how Josh did it, to see if there’s any tricks.</p>
                
                <p>After watching the video I completed the challenge, which was also the end of Module 3.</p>
                
                <p>Overall these three challenges (progress bar, select element, and input element styling) were great practice. I was able to create vanilla CSS component modules and classes that allowed me style selectively. Each of these challenges led me to create a reference project to add to my references project. </p>
                
                <p>I was able to translate the vanilla CSS to React and styled components. I learned about the tool Storybook and spent some extra time investigating how this was implemented within the project.</p>
                
                <p>I feel I now know so much more about React and styled components, even though this is not a course on either of those. I am glad about this because of my intention that existed prior to this course to learn about them. On top of that, my CSS skills have gained a great boost as well.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: Reference Project</h3>
                <p>I added the input styling and breadcrumbs projects to the reference project and added the appropriate links to the main page. </p>

                <h3>Building: Select Element Reference Project</h3>
                <p>Today I finalized a select element method for having a functional and custom designed element. This project is in relation to the 2nd challenge in Module 3 of CSS for JavaScript Developers course. </p>
                
                <p>I made notes on why each rule and declaration’s purpose is so when I reference it again it should be clear what the heck is going on. </p>
                
                <p>I added this to the reference project and updated this project by adding links to all the reference projects within. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>I then finished the 2nd challenge for the select element by applying the HTML and styles via styled components. </p>
                
                <p>I started the 3rd challenge where we are styling up an input that has an icon within it. This is a tricky challenge and I encountered the methodology before. It is a pattern that’s definitely “out there.”</p>
                
                <p>Before I get to the discussing this pattern, I just want to mention that how I have been doing the last two challenges is to code it up outside of React and styled components, then once I have it working with vanilla CSS and JavaScript (JS for the second challenge; not for the third) it is super easy to convert it into React components and style it with styled components and it helps with my understanding. </p>
                
                <p>Back to the pattern for these input elements: The pattern is to use the label element as the container. The icon is removed from flow using absolute positioning and then given space to exist using padding on the input. </p>
                
                <p>There is a trick here. When the padding is added to the input, this extends the input by that amount. So using width: 100% on the input element will not work as expected. It will break out of the label container by the amount of padding that was added. This is solved using the calc function on the input.</p>
                
                <p>Over the course of these challenges I have become much more familiar with the usefulness of relative units. What I have been doing is setting sizes with rem units on the parent and then using ems for all the descendants. This just makes a lot more sense to me and give me one source of control on the parent container. Or at least it seems to be the case. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Last night I made really good progress on the progress bar component. I took advantage of the progress HTML element. Once I got it looking good I started watching the solution video.</p>
                
                <p>Josh went with using a div and the proper aria role instead of using the progress HTML element. I actually like this approach for the simple fact that styling a progress element is not widely supported across browsers and bulky in terms of having to special pseudo-elements. And, even with the pseudo elements, these only work for Chrome and Safari and not Firefox. </p>
                
                <p>Awesomely, as soon as I started the solution video I paused it and started doing it all myself. It was cool seeing my chosen solutions being validated by the much more experienced Josh. This kind of validation is important at this stage in my developing web development skills. It is affirming.</p>
                
                <p>I completed the progress bar with great satisfaction.</p>
                
                <p>Started on the styling the select element challenge. Learned a very nifty way to style select elements by watching Josh’s tutorial. It separates the functionality provided by the select menu from the look of the select menu. Basically the select element sits on top of the styled portion as an invisible layer (basically the select element is set to 0 opacity). This allows us to easily style the select portion in a way that will be consistent across browsers. Clicking the element reveals the functionality provided by the select element. This is crafty and I like it a lot.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Even with box-sizing set to border-box, if width and height is not specified explicitly, it will behave the same as if box-sizing was set to content-box.</p>
                
                <p>This is interesting to me because so many people claim how much more useful border-box is versus content-box, yet it doesn’t seem very often that explicit width and height is specified, especially when one is making a website responsive. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Continuing with module 3. I watched the solution video to yesterday’s challenge. This was helpful. Of course he solved it in an entirely different way. This is one of the things I like about coding. There’s so many ways to do the same thing. </p>
                
                <p>I actually liked how I did it more versus how he did it, but I learned about a new functionality with styled components that I want to try in the future. Styled components allow for building on what are essentially base classes. This is similar to how classes in JavaScript can be extended. </p>
                
                <p>Today I learned about the importance of grouping contextual styles to prevent the hunting that can come with having styles for a component spread out. His solution is tied to styled components and uses what he calls inversion of control nesting, where the parent child section is nested within the child being styled.  This effectively groups all the contextual stylings with the item being contextually styled.</p>
                
                <p>Using vanilla CSS I see that this could be done, not with inversion of control nesting, as that isn’t possible within vanilla CSS, but through grouping contextually styled elements together. Instead of having the contextual style be grouped with the parent, they are grouped together based on the element being contextually styled. This creates an easy way to find and change/update styles, as well as see more clearly what all will be effected by a change. </p>
                
                <p>——————————————————————</p>
                
                <p>I’ve reached the workshop portion of module 3 and this one seems like it could be a doozy. Looks like I will be learning about a tool called Storybook, which is used for helping developers create components and quickly test them with different property values. </p>
                
                <p>It looks like a lot of folks have given feedback on this one as well about its difficulty. This actually excites me quite a bit. </p>
                
                <p>There are 3 components we are building: a progress bar, a Select component, and an Icon Input (I think this is for adding icons to an input. </p>
                
                <p>The first phase of this is going through the README and getting familiar with the project structure and files and with Storybook. </p>
                
                <p>It seems like all the actual visualizing will be occurring in Storybook which will be run via local host.</p>
                
                <p>I started on this workshop with the process bar challenge. The challenge itself started off with me looking up how these are applied using using MDN docs on ARIA roles.</p>
                
                <p>I then spent some time reading some articles on how to style the <progress> element, then I got started on the actual challenge.</p>
                
                <p>I feel like I have learned a lot about styled components and React. At last relatively speaking. I am sure there is SO much I have no clue about, but I know that I know much more today than I did yesterday. </p>

                <p>Continuing with module 3. Getting more practice with styled components and React. </p>
                
                <p>Had to use the iPad and GoodNotes to write out my understanding on how certain properties were working.</p>
                
                <p>The React component has properties, which are the parameters of the function, but then styled components also has properties, which are specified on the actual component being styled. This layer of properties (the styled components properties) are accessed using interpolation functions, which basically utilizes the template literal ‘${}’ syntax.</p>
                
                <p>It took a bit of time and analysis to realize how these layers of properties work, then how to actually use them. The exercises I went through today helped me gain a better understanding of what the hell is going on.</p>
                
                <p>I definitely feel the mental stretching occurring here and I like the feeling. Is it a bit stressful? Yes and no. Mostly no. As for the ‘yes’ I would say the stress is positive. At least it is when I respond to it appropriately, which is to say I take my time and be sensitive to what parts I am not understanding. It is only when I disengage form the sensitivity that it becomes negatively stressful. Luckily I have a good amount of experience with this stress and I am getting better at responding to it appropriately. </p>
                
                <p>Today has definitely made me feel like the best way to learn the JavaScript I need to learn to learn React is to learn React. Learning must occur within context and the context of React is so JavaScript heavy that it makes for a great learning context. </p>

            <p>Starting on Module 3 today, which is about component architecture.</p>
            
            <p>A lot of this module is about using styled-components, which I have been wanting to get into, along with React.</p>
            
            <p>I am feeling myself a bit anxiety-ridden now. Should I start learning React right now, so I can start using style-components? Am I skilled enough in JavaScript to start learning React? I feel like the game plan has been a bit knocked off its track. </p>
            
            <p>I really like aspects of styled-components, such as not having to think of class names, which is not a very fun thing to do, even with methodologies like BEM or Cube CSS. </p>
            
            <p>I also really like what I’ve seen of React. I get excited thinking about React. I also know the job prospects for React are pretty large. </p>
            
            <p>For now, I have things to do.</p>
            
            <p>I spent some time writing out about styled components, which involved explaining to myself both the JSX syntax, as well as the syntax for styled-components, which uses tagged template literals. It’s different, but also pretty straightforward me thinks. </p>
            
            <h3>Building: Space Tourism site</h3>
            <p>Getting started on the actual site today. </p>
            
            <p>Well, actually I wrapped up the design system by writing a blurb about it in the project README file. </p>
            
            <p>To start on the homepage of the site is to start on the Burger Menu. To learn how to do this I am building out a reference project that is following <a href="https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/" target="_blank">Andy Bell’s tutorial on creating a progressively enhanced and fully responsive burger menu</a>. </p>
            
            <p>This tutorial is layered in its education. It is a practice in using BEM class naming (something that would be completely unnecessary with styled-components), as well as in accessibility and focus behavior. It is also teaching about progressive enhancement, which is a coding philosophy I can get behind for sure. </p>
            
            <p>Got all the way up to the JavaScript portion. Right now the site is minimally functional. If JavaScript weren’t working, or was disabled by the user, this site would still be perfectly usable for all users. That’s awesome.</p>
            
            <p>Tomorrow I begin to enhance the behavior of this menu. I am excited.</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for Developers</h3>

                <p>Completed the project for module 2, which was an interesting exercise.</p>
                
                <p>What made it most interesting was that it was a React application, which added a layer on top of exercising what I learned within the module. I am not so familiar with React yet. I have had a brief intro to it 4 months or so ago while taking a Node.js course. That bit of experience helped me with this.</p>
                
                <p>I really like React and how the projects are compartmentalized into components. I am looking forward to learning React soon.</p>
                
                <p>This exercise was all about practicing principles learned in Module 2. It was about utilizing positioning layout with absolute, relative and fixed positions. It also involved stacking context and overflow. </p>
                
                <p>I challenged myself by not engaging in z-index wars and really thinking in terms of the stacking contexts created and how the flow ordering impacts what gets laid on top of what. </p>
                
                <p>I was able to complete it and all the challenges without too much trouble. I even managed to complete the “stretch” challenge which was intended for more “advanced” students. It could have probably been done better, but it worked! I am looking forward to watching the review.</p>
                
                <p>Watched the review, learned better ways to size the fixed image by using percentages and using opposite value (top and bottom) to set height.</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Almost finished module 2. Went over how to hide things via <code class='code-inline'>display: none</code>, <code class='code-inline'>visibility: hidden</code>, and the opacity property.</p>
                
                <p>This section discussed the differences between these. The <code class='code-inline'>display: none</code> declaration removes an element completely from the DOM and it becomes truly inaccessible.</p>
                
                <p>The <code class='code-inline'>visibility: hidden</code> declaration makes the element invisible, but does not remove it from flow. Its box with all its box properties are still there. This can be useful for selectively revealing items, such as answers to questions. </p>
                
                <p>Interestingly, with this property one can set a parent element to be visibly hidden, and then selectively set children to be visible. </p>
                
                <p>This property also removes items from being clickable, selectable, and focusable.</p>
                
                <p>The last property, <code class='code-inline'>opacity</code>, works similarly to <code class='code-inline'>visibility: hidden</code> in that the element remains in flow. However, a key difference is that the element is still clickable, selectable and focusable which can create weird user experiences for people using screen readers.</p>
                
                <p>The most important section of this section, I think, is how to visually hide things for screen users, while keeping them “visible” for screen-reader users. This is important for items like buttons that only contain icons.</p>
                
                <p>There are many ways to do this. One method is to set the <code class='code-inline'>aria-label: “Button Label Here”</code> attribute, but this sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t depending on context. </p>
                
                <p>The method described by Josh involves a CSS utility class called ‘screen-reader-only’ or ‘sr-only’. What this does is it takes the element and moves it out of the way through clever declarations so it is not visible to screen users, yet will be ‘visible’ for screen reader users.</p>
                
                <p>I added this useful utility to my utilities.css template. </p>
                
                <p>I am leaving the project portion of this section for tomorrow as today is filled with non-coding related chores. I am now moving on to the Space Tourism website.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Website</h3>
                <p>Last time I left off by finishing up the Design System html file. I wills tart today by reviewing what I did, then watching the tutorial on this section and making adjustments if I feel it improves what I’ve already accomplished. After this it will be time to get started on the actual site!</p>
                
                <p>While watching the tutorial:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I changed the class name of the large button from ‘main-button’ to ‘large-button’. This makes
                        sense because it is less specific and so this component could be used elsewhere in the site in
                        the future if it is needed. ‘main-button’ is too specific as it implies only one, whereas
                        ‘large-button’ only indicates size, not importance.
                    </li>
                    <li>The other thing changed was the element itself. I changed it from a button to a link. I did this
                        because it is what Kevin did, however it led me to the question: When should I use a button and
                        when should I use a link? This led me to researching on the web and reading a few different
                        articles.
                        <ul>
                            <li> What I seen several times is that buttons should be used when a change is made to the
                                front or back-end and a link should be used when directing to a new page or section. But
                                isn’t a new page opening a change to the front-end?
                            </li>
                            <li> I read about how links should look like links, and not like buttons to work with the
                                expectations of users. However, this does not seem to be something that is followed very
                                often. For example, this link I am styling right now in this project.
                            </li>
                            <li> I read about how there is a difference when it comes to accessibility as well and I
                                think this is the more important thing to consider.
                            </li>
                            <li> For this project, I know that this ‘button’ will be leading to a page, so it is
                                definitely a link, not a button and therefore the markup should follow this. So it makes
                                sense to use a link tag.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Styling this link was another opportunity to play around with the balance between component
                        styling and using utility classes. The link component ‘large-button’ has certain dimensions, but
                        there are aspects of this component that could change in different sections. Things like the
                        background-color and the font-color and maybe even the font-family itself. The things that
                        change are great utility class use candidates.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Very happy to learn about a new way of creating a circular ‘button’ with centered text. This method utilizes vertical padding along with aspect-ration property. This creates the circle. To center the text I would usually utilize display:flex with justify-content and align-items set to center. But I really like this new (for me) way of using display:grid with place-items: center. This saves me a line of code. I like it. </p>
                
                <p>When it comes to creating the large border that shows up on hovering, there are several options. For sure I know I do not want the layout to change when this border appears. </p>
                
                <p>I thought that if I create the border I could just make its color be transparent/0% opacity and alter this upon hovering, but this didn’t work. What occurred is the background color was revealed. I did not realize setting a border extends the background to the outer edge of the border. I thought that the background-color would stay within the content box itself. I tried changing the box-sizing back  to content-box , but this didn’t work either. </p>
                
                <p>The next thing was to set the border to be the same color as the background itself. This works, however in the actual website it looks like a background-image is being used and so this border may be visible depending on the background-image, and this is not what I want either. </p>
                
                <p>The next thing is to use an outline. Outlines do not alter the layout. Using an outline means that I would want to add a margin to this button that is at least the width of the border so the outline does not clash with other content.</p>
                
                <p>After setting the move up using outline, I watched Kevin’s methodology. The way he went about it was by using the ::after pseudo element. This method was interesting and I did feel like I learned a bit more about how these work, however I feel this was an extremely complex way to go about it. </p>
                
                <p>I could accomplish the same thing with a whole lot less lines of code. I wish I could ask him why he chose the method he did versus using outline, especially given that when he set the :hover pseudo class he also defined the :focus pseudo class along with it, which is setting the outline behavior. </p>

                <p>Today is Sunday. For the most part this is a day off for me. With that said I did makes some progress. I also spent time organizing some of the notes and resources I have that are coding related to make them more efficient and logically structured.</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Continued with Module 2. Finished the sticky positioning section.</p>
                
                <p>Sticky positioning is definitely an interesting declaration. It is tied with scrolling. Without scrolling sticky will do nothing. </p>
                
                <p>It has 2 requirements: <code class='code-inline'>position: sticky</code> and at least one top/left/bottom/right value declared, which assigns where the element will stick. </p>
                
                <p>If we set the top value to 0, then what this means is that the element will stick to directly onto the parent’s top edge. If the page scrolls down, then the stickiness occurs at the viewport’s edge until the bottom edge of the parent container is reached. The sticky element cannot leave the boundary of its parent, except with negative top/left/bottom/right values.</p>
                
                <p>Because sticky positioning is tied to scrolling, this means that setting an overflow property on any of the sticky elements ancestors will impact how the element sticks. If the parent has overflow auto, hidden, or scroll set, but doesn’t have a fixed height set along with overflowing content, then it will appear as if sticky positioning is “not working”. It’s a similar situation that occurs if the parent doesn’t have overflow set, but also isn’t tall (or wide) enough.</p>
                
                <p>I created a nifty reference project with a sticky header and some cool sticky section labels that I will most likely be using on a portfolio or resume project in the future. </p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Continued with the Design System page.</p>
                
                <p>Realizing that building this page is mostly about practice. Building it out isn’t very helpful for identifying component patterns or design patterns because all the markup here is outside of the context of the actual website itself. </p>
                
                <p>The most challenging thing of this is simply naming the classes. Sometimes the class name is mostly accurate. For example, in the Typography section, there is a sub-headings component and I created a styling class for the header of this component and because I didn’t see a reason to create a whole new class for the ‘body text’ section (it was using almost all the same styling, except for the color), I used this class name on it. </p>
                
                <p>A fix for the problem would be to come up with a less specific class name. However, naming things is a bitch.</p>
                
                <p>This pain of naming is actually a good case for using utility classes. Instead of creating a new class for each of the headings and subheadings I was able to utilize the utility classes to quickly style them within the HTML. </p>
                
                <p>After I prepped the page I continued watching the tutorial. This is definitely the better order. Make first then watch. Yes, it may mean me redoing some of the work I’ve done as I learn how to do something more efficiently, but this is not bad at all. Making “mistakes,” for me at least, is the best way to learn.</p>
                
                <p>This actually reinforced a decision I made when it came to the numbered titles on the page. Because all of these shared the same kind of styling I created a class instead of using utility classes. This is exactly what Kevin Powell did, however he did it a bit more efficiently. </p>
                
                <p>When I selected for the titles I used element sectors, whereas he created an actual class with a perfectly descriptive name, “numbered-title.” (Why the hell didn’t I think of that?!).</p>
                
                <p>I then went ahead and finished the last section of the design system on my own. I will watch the tutorial on how he did this and make adjustments where necessary. </p>
                
                <p>I did mess around with using inline-styles, despite myself. Specifically I used this for specifying different values for variables. I am not so sure about this workflow though. But I think messing with it is allowing me to come up with an experiential reason why to avoid them (or use them).</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Continuing with Module 2.</p>
                
                <p>Wrapped up stacking contexts by learning about portals, which are libraries of a sort to use when working with React. These allow one to create modals that will be rendered alongside the root element, thus allowing DOM order to control the stacking order by declaring <code class='code-inline'>isolation: isolate</code> on the root element.</p>
                
                <p>Right now this is now so relevant, but I made a note of it.</p>
                
                <p>I moved on, learning about Fixed Position. Fixed position is always in relation to the viewport.</p>
                
                <p>When searching about the default positioned ancestor on an absolutely positioned element that does not have an ancestor with a position declaration I have seen people say that it is the body element. However through some explorations I have not found this to be so true. What I did find is that the viewport is the parent. This is also the case with Fixed position.</p>
                
                <p>There are exceptions to this rule. The first exception is that if there is any ancestor, no matter how far up the DOM tree that has a transform declaration, then the fixed element will behave as an absolutely positioned element in relation to this ancestor.</p>
                
                <p>The other exception is if an ancestor has a declaration of  <code class='code-inline'>will-change: transform</code>. </p>
                
                <p>There is a pretty nifty script that Josh introduced to hunt up the DOM tree to find the parent. This script is simple, yet quite helpful. I love things like this.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Travel Website</h3>
                <p>I updated the stylesheet to implement certain naming schemes I saw Kevin Powell use. </p>
                
                <p>I decided I liked his naming scheme for CSS Variables. Specifically using the prefix of ‘fs’ for font-sizes, and ‘ff’ for font-family. Using these makes it really easy to find them when working further down in the stylesheet. </p>
                
                <p>I also like how he used the relative values for his font size utility classes. His naming scheme is to use the font-weight number scale (100-900). At first I was hesitant to use this, but it started to make sense to me. The reason it makes sense is because font-size is being set with rem units and so, yes these are based on pixels, but ultimately this value is dependent upon the user. </p>
                
                <p>It is more accurate to use this relative scale, then to call them by the pixel name. Before this I was not using font-size utility classes and would be declaring them using var(--150px), etc. This would only be accurate if the user does not change the browser default font-size. Naming is already hard enough, the least I can do is do my best to use naming schemes that are more accurate, such as this.</p>
                
                <p>I began rebuilding the design system page from the ground up and using less utility classes. I am curious if there is a benefit to having more classes on an element or more rules in the stylesheet. I am still learning the balance and projects like this are the perfect way to find that balance.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: Reference Projects</h3>
                <p>I created a remote repo for some of the projects I created recently that are serving as reference projects.  So far this consists of Centering with Absolute Positioning, Tooltip, and a Stacking Contexts project.</p>
                
                <p>I have been using my laptop for the last few weeks, but I also have several projects on my desktop computer that I am planning on adding to this repo. This makes for more good practice with pushing and pulling using git.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for Developers</h3>
                <p>I started today by rebuilding the tooltips reference project and adding a README file for it which explained the thought process behind each of the properties. </p>
                
                <p>This was helpful for me. Yesterday I was a bit overwhelmed by all the parts involved in making these, but there was definitely some information digestion in the time period between then and now. </p>
                
                <p>Continuing with Module 2 and learning about stacking contexts. I do have a decent understanding about how these works. At this point they feel pretty intuitive. </p>
                
                <p>I did learn about new ways to create stacking contexts. The one declaration I am particularly excited about is isolation: isolate. I like the way this behaves in that it requires the least amount of code to create a stacking context.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Travel Website</h3>
                <p>Decided to watch a bit of the tutorial that goes along with this project to see if I could pick up on some pointers. The tutorial is done by Kevin Powell and I do find some of his stuff to be helpful.</p>
                
                <p>As I was watching, I remembered that I don’t like following project tutorials. I just feel like it’s cheating myself of valuable experience. With that said I did learn a few things as far as creating css utility classes and using CSS variables. </p>
                
                <p>I am definitely interested in seeing how the images are implemented. I can see there are various size images for the different layouts (mobile, tablet, desktop) and I have been meaning to learn about using the srcset attribute. I will be checking the tutorial out for that. </p>
                
                <p>Tomorrow I will be getting back to the Cube CSS methodology and will be using the tutorial for this project only when I want an idea of how something is done as opposed to watching all the videos. Having a tutorial to follow is okay, but also unrealistic. Part of the fun of these projects is encountering something I don’t know and having to find the answer. So as I go along I will learn how to balance this.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Learning about Positioning Layout. </p>
                
                <p>One difference between how relative and absolute positioning works is to what top, right, bottom, left values are relative. With relative positioning these are relative to the position the element sits within the flow. With absolute positioning these values are relative to the nearest ancestor with a positioning layout value set (position: static/initial is not a positioning layout value; it is the value of a flow layout element). </p>
                
                <p>Learned a couple ways to center absolutely positioned elements using the top, right, bottom, left values along with margin: auto. </p>
                
                <p>There was a short challenge which had me create a tooltip. This highlighted a use case for absolute positioning. It also involved some of the finer points of how absolutely positioning works in relationship to its positioned parent and that parent’s display value. </p>
                
                <p>I created 2 reference projects for both centering and for the tooltip so I can refer back to them in the future.  </p>

                <h3>Building: Frontend Mentor - Space Travel Website</h3>
                <p>I picked a project on Frontend Mentor to start today. At first I was a bit overwhelmed. This is usual whenever I begin a project. However, I have, over the last several months, developed a trust in the process.</p>
                
                <p>The process starts with simply setting up the project itself. Getting the project directories set up, downloading assets, and looking over the design templates and setting up the remote repo. </p>
                
                <p>I made some notes of the things I know I will need to look up, such as making a hamburger menu (I’ll be using <a href="https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/" target="_blank">this tutorial on building hamburger menus</a> when the time comes), as well as other navigational features.</p>
                
                <p>After doing this I felt the excitement overtake the overwhelm. The journey has begun and I have a map of what to do.</p>
                
                <p>This <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3" target="_blank">specific project</a> is part of the free projects available on Frontend Mentor, but this one does give access to the Figma design files. This is helpful because there is much more information about the design, such as font sizes and colors to use. I spent some time looking that over and prepping some the css styles. </p>
                
                <p>I also decided to start reading about <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/cube-css/" target="_blank">Andy Bell’s Cube CSS methodology</a> and do my best to apply the principles to this project. Immediate application really is the best way to learn.</p>
                
                <p>I will also be reinforcing a mobile-first design approach and will be continuing Comeau’s CSS for JavaScript Developers course applying those learnings to this project as well.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes I try too hard to plan things out, but I feel there is value, at my stage, in getting in there and making a bit of a mess. A lot of realizations come from that and make for better experience when it comes to planning in the future. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Completed module 1 today. </p>
                
                <p>Learned about the complexities of margin collapse, which I had no idea about before. I will not say I am an expert at it, but now I have more familiarity with how it works. </p>
                
                <p>A case was even made to avoid margins altogether, which I thought was interesting. The context of this has to do with thinking in styled components. The idea being that component edges shouldn’t impact their outer environment and this makes sense to me. </p>
                
                <p>There was an end of module challenge which I was able to complete without too much trouble at all. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Revisited my CSS reset stylesheet and compared and contrast it with both <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/">Josh’s</a> and <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/">Andy Bell’s</a> (2 developers I look up to).</p>
                
                <p>Some things I adopted into my own CSS are scroll-behavior being set to smooth on the root element and a media query for users that prefer reduced motion. The latter sets the scroll-behavior to its default as well as reduces animation and transition durations. </p>
                
                <p>Much of today’s learning was review for me, but useful review. What was reviewed and gone over in detail was the Box Model. There was good practice in reiterating the difference between content-box and border-box and it makes even more sense now.</p>
                
                <p>Learned about a nifty feature of the margin property: by setting negative margins on left and right an element can be stretched.</p>
                
                <p>I also learned that the fit-content width value requires a vendor prefix for Firefox. I love encountering things like this. Information that corrects and updates my current mental models seem to stick so much more.</p>
                
                <p>I also learned more about the Flow Layout and the different behaviors of the display values: block, inline, and inline-block.</p>
                
                <p>Again, this was most review, but these are foundational aspects so reviewing doesn’t hurt.</p>
                
                <p>Next up I went through the section on width. I learned some stuff here.</p>
                
                <p>Specifically I learned about the difference between width: auto (this is the default value) and width: 100%. When the width of an element is set to 100% it means that the element’s content-box will always be 100% the size of its parent. If horizontal margin is added to the element, then there’s a chance the element may break out of its parent because that margin will be added to the width which is already 100%. This is good to know~</p>
                
                <p>I also learned about some keywords to use for width. In addition to fit-content, which I already knew about, I learned about min-content and max-content. These keywords are interesting because they are intrinsic values, which means the width is not based on the parent (extrinsic), but is based on the width of the children.</p>
                
                <p>With min-content this means the element looks for the longest single word and then makes its width be equal to that word. That longest word becomes the width of the element.</p>
                
                <p>With max-content the width of the element is equal to the width of the widest child. If a header is very long it means the width will be as long as that line is without any line-breaks. This can break outside of a parent. </p>
                
                <p>Both of these methods are interesting ways to shrink wrap content, but the most straight-forward one seems to be fit-content (just have to be sure to add the vendor prefix for Firefox!)</p>

                <p>Finished Chapter 10: Prototypes</p>
                
                <p>This is the last chapter in this course. </p>
                
                <p>I spent some time learning about prototype chains awhile back. This chapter helped me better understand what these are, especially in the context of the ‘wiring’ mental model.</p>
                
                <p>Prototypes are mostly relevant when reading property values. If a property is being written, this will occur on the object that the property is being written to, not a prototype.</p>
                
                <p>It is possible to write to an object’s prototype. This is called Prototype Pollution and for the most part should be avoided. </p>
                
                <p>Every newly created object has as its prototype a default Object Prototype which is where all those fancy methods and properties live and are accessible from. The prototype of the Object Prototype is just null. This is the end of the line for every prototype chain. </p>
                
                <p>Like properties, prototype chains are unidirectional. They flow down stream in the form of object chains. A prototype cannot access the properties of the object of which it is a prototype. </p>
                
                <p>This course was simply awesome. Probably one of the most useful courses I have taken in my coding journey. I will most likely be revisiting it over and over. </p>
                
                <p>The exercises provided were crucial for reinforcing the mental model. I am looking forward to diving into some projects to continue the reinforcement. </p>

                <p>Finished Chapter 9: Mutations</p>
                
                <p>This chapter was enlightening. I now know with surety what object mutation is and how to avoid it if necessary. </p>
                
                <p>Mutation is altering the property values of an object that is already created. </p>
                
                <p>I also learned about the const keyword and due to the mental model of wires I can grasp its usage much more clearly. The ‘const’ keyword only prevents rewiring the value a variable is connect to, but will not prevent mutation of an object. </p>
                
                <p>The concept that objects are never nested within other objects was also reinforced into my mental model. I’ve said it before, but this makes so much more sense than thinking of properties of objects and variables in terms of boxes. The ‘box’ mental model has beeb stayed and its death is most welcome.</p>
                
                <p>One thing I realized that was not mentioned in the course is how the flow of the wires of object value properties is uni-directional. It flows out from the object value that the property was ‘born’ from,  but does not flow backwards. This makes perfect sense when a property is wired to a primitive value, but can be confusing when a property is wired to another object value. </p>

                <p>This is supposed to be a day off, but I just can’t help myself here.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Just JavaScript</h3>
                <p>Today I went through Chapter 8: Properties.</p>
                
                <p>This expands on the variable mental model of wires connecting to values. Essentially properties behave like wires and just like all wires in this mental model they must be connected to a value. </p>
                
                <p>One difference between properties and variables is that variables are code which point/connect to values. Properties don’t start from code, but start from values (object values). Variables are code connecting to values; properties are values connecting to other values. </p>
                
                <p>Another aspect is that properties are not inside objects, but are simply connections that are grouped together via the object value. The object value is a sort of hub for values and the properties are what connect the values to the hub. </p>
                
                <p>The reason this is helpful is because the values of connected to properties are available to other variables and other object values. They don’t enter the object to gain access, but simply connect via their own wires to these values. </p>
                
                <p>How can something be in two boxes at the same time? This is the problem with the box mental model. The wire mental model is more accurate in explaining the behavior of variables and properties. </p>
                
                <p>I also learned about what the ‘this’ keyword does. The course doesn’t go over ‘this’ but through one of the problems I learned more about it.</p>
                
                <pre><code>//The code below would throw an error because the 'next' property is pointing to the 'president' variable's value before it has been declared. 
                
let president = {
    name: "Goofy",
    next: president
}
                
// Without the 'this' keyword this is accomplished like so:
                
let president = {
    name: "Goofy",
}

president.next = president;
                
//The same thing above can be accomplished with less code by using the 'this' keyword:
                
let president = {
    name: "Goofy",
    next: this,
}</code></pre>
                <p>When an object gets more complicated ‘this’ becomes even more useful. Encountering this problem helped me understand how ‘this’ behaves and what it replaces. I now have a better grasp on what ‘this’ is abstracting. </p>
                
                <p>I also learned about how the dot operator works in regards to accessing properties. </p>
                
                <p>If the value to the left of the ‘.’ is undefined or null an error is thrown, otherwise it moves forward.</p>
                
                <p>This makes sense because ‘undefined’ and ‘null’ are primitive values and do not posses any properties in and of themselves. </p>
                
                <p>If a property of an object hasn’t been declared, trying to access it will result in undefined. This does not mean that in doing so a property is created and wired to the value ‘undefined’. In other languages trying to access a property that doesn’t exist would result in an error. In the Universe that is JavaScript, this results in the value ‘undefined’. It’s just a law of this Universe. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Continuing with the introductory module. Continued learning about units by reading <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/">Josh’s article</a>.</p>
                
                <p>I found this article informative. It revealed a bad habit I have developed of using pixels for font sizes. This is bad for accessibility reasons. Moving forward I will be using rem units for font-sizing.</p>
                
                <p>He made an interesting case for using ems for vertical margins, which prevents excess code writing. For example: if I wanted my margins for all headers no matter what type to be 0.75x their font-size size I would have to calculate that value for every header if I were using rem units. However if I were to use ems for the margins I could just have one rule with a selector for all headers and set the margin (vertical) to 0.75em and this would take care of it  that size, then I would have to calculate that rem value.</p>
                
                <p>The article also made a very interesting case for using rem units for media queries. I am still wrapping my head around this. The example he uses to highlight the usefulness of doing this has to do with a page layout that has a vertical navigation on the left hand side. If a user bumped the default browser font size to 32px and pixels were used in the media query, then the navigation would end up taking up a larger portion of the available space, squeezing the main content. </p>
                
                <p>By using rems for the media query, when the user bumps up the font size, then the media query breakpoints would also change. In this case what would occur is the page would be following the mobile specifications and the navigation would become collapsible. This is pretty neat!</p>
                
                <p>The article was very thorough and offered some interesting workflows and I applied some of the ideas to this website and am looking forward to making these ideas a part of my workflow.</p>
                
                <p>With that said it was also emphasized that there are no hard rules and that the more projects we build the more our intuition will build in regards to determining what kinds of units to use.</p>
                
                <p>He left me with a good mental model for deciding in the form of a simple, yet powerful question: Do I want this to scale up when a user changes a browser’s default font size?</p>
                
                <p>It’s all about the mental models these days. I love em!</p>

                <h3>Learning CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Continued with the introductory module.</p>
                
                <p>Went over colors and the 3 main keywords to use to set colors (RGB, Hexadecimal, and HSL). </p>
                
                <p>A pretty good case was made for using HSL. The argument is that HSL is much more intuitive. If a we want a color darker we adjust the light percentage, 100% being fully white and 0% fully black (default is therefore 50%). If we want a color to be less vibrant we reduce the Saturation percentage. </p>
                
                <p>One thing I don’t like about HSL is that it is mathematical and so there are aspects that are not so intuitive. Brightness (saturation) is one of these aspects. Humans don’t perceive color saturation equally across colors. Given equal saturation some colors will appear to our eyes to be more or less bright than they actually are. It’s similar with sound: low frequencies will sound quieter than higher frequencies at the same decibel level. And even this changes based on the overall decibel level. </p>
                
                <p>I am still debating which color keyword to use moving forward, but I will experiment with HSL for a time to see how I like it.</p>
                
                <p>Another thing covered has to do with units: pixels, ems, rems and percentages.</p>
                
                <p>I’ve heard many different preferences. Josh prefers rems, which I like as well as there is a single point of truth to which all rems units are relative. </p>
                
                <p>He did mention that when setting the font-size on the root element to avoid using pixels and instead use percentages. This is because when we set a font-size in pixels on the root element this will overwrite a user’s preference and I agree that this should be avoided. By using percentages it will adjust the site’s font size relative to the user preference. </p>
                
                <p>I was a bit sad that vh vw and vmax were not mentioned, but they may come up later. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Just JavaScript</h3>
                <h4>Chapter 6: Meeting Objects and Functions</h4>
                <p>Objects and functions are both values. These are values that can be summoned (similar to primitive values), but in order for an object value and function value to be summoned it first must be created. </p>

                <p>That’s right! Objects and functions are values that we get to create! Joy!</p>
                
                <p>There are many types of objects. Dates, arrays, RegExps, Number, Math, etc.</p>
                
                <p>Objects can be created, but not destroyed. JavaScript has a garbage collection, but when this occurs cannot be guaranteed. </p>
                
                <p>Functions are objects, but with special properties. Functions possess the capabilities of objects, but not necessarily vice versa.</p>
                
                <p>When a variable is wired up to a function value, that function is created at that point in time. </p>
                
                <p>If another variable is created an wired to a function value that looks the same, it does not wire up to the same function value; a new function value is created. To wire up a variable to the same function value, then the variable must point to the function value already wired up to the other variable. (Ex: let oldVariable = function(){}; let newVariable = oldVariable;)</p>
                
                <p>In order for the code within the function body to be run, it must be called using ‘().’ When a function is called it is a <i>call expression.</i> The call expression is answered by JavaScript by running the code, resulting in whatever value is returned.</p>
                
                <p>Writing it out:</p>

                <pre><code>
let plant = function () {
    return {};
};

let tree = plant();

let flower = plant();
                </code></pre>
                
                <p>The first line created a variable called ‘plant’ and wires this up to a newly created function value.</p>
                
                <p>The second line creates a new variable called ‘tree’ and wires it up to another newly created object.</p>
                
                <p>That process looks like this: </p>
                <p>The plant variable expression results in a function value. This function value enters into the call expression, which results in an object literal expression, which results in a newly created object. </p>
                
                <p>The third line creates a new variable called ‘flower’ and runs the same process above and is wired up to another new object.</p>
                
                <p>After all this code runs there are 3 newly created values! A function value and two distinct object values. </p>

                <h4>Chapter 7: Equality of Values</h4>

                <p>There are three kinds of equality: Strict Equality (a === b), Loose Equality (a == b) and Same Value Equality (Object.is(a, b)).</p>

                <p>I have not encountered Same Value Equality yet, but this chapter started with it. </p>
                
                <p>Due to the mental models of values that has been set up throughout the course so far, Same Value Equality is easy to grasp. Where I once would have been confused (objects), I am no longer confused due to what I learned in Chapter 5. </p>
                
                <p>Strict Equality almost behaves the same, except for two special cases. </p>
                
                <p>Both cases deal with primitive special numerical cases.</p>
                
                <p>The first one has to do with NaN. With Strict Equality NaN === NaN is always false, whereas Object.is(NaN, NaN) is true. </p>
                
                <p>The second case has to do with -0 and 0. We know that -0 and 0 are individual and unique values and Same Value Equality shows this is the case:</p>
                
                <p>Object.is(-0, 0) will result in false, whereas -0 === 0 will always result in true. </p>
                
                <p>Out of these two special cases the one that will most likely be encountered is the case dealing with NaN. In order to check that a value is NaN we can do one of three things:</p>
                <p>Object.is(someVariable, NaN)</p>
                <p>Number.isNaN(someVariable)</p>
                <p>someVariable !== someVariable</p>
                
                <p>Out in the world, Strict Equality is what I will be using fo the most part, but it is super helpful to be aware fo those two special cases, especially the first. </p>
                
                <p>As for Loose Equality, I got one word: YUCK.</p>
                
                <p>I will not be using it if I can avoid it.</p>
                
                <p>Here is a useful resource which shows all the strange results of Loose Equality: <a href="https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/">JS Comparison Table</a></p>
                
                <p>This course doesn’t cover it so much and essentially warns to use with caution. </p>
                
                <p>But again, I am simply going to avoid the use altogether. </p>
                
                <p>One potential useful use case is: variableName == null</p>
                
                <p>This is like this: someVariable === null || someVariable === undefined</p>
                
                <p>But seriously? Is that really that much more code to write? I say no.</p>

                <h4>Chapter 3: Values and Variables</h4>
                <p>A number of mental models were established within this chapter.</p>

                <p>These mental models build on the mental model of values and are related to variables.</p>
                
                <p>These mental models are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Primitive values are immutable. Object and functions are mutable.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are wires; they are associations between the variable name and the value.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are not values, but wires connecting to values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are expressions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables cannot point to other variables, only to values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are never ‘passed’ into functions; the value the variable points to is what is passed.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>This mental model helps to isolate the focus.</p>

                <p>Any programming involves so many layers of abstraction and it can get easy to get lost in these layers. This mental model holds us within the appropriate layer. </p>
                
                <p>We don’t care about how the computer stores the memory and how all that craziness works. It’s just a distraction. What we care about are the qualities, characteristics and governing laws of JavaScript. That’s what we study. </p>
                
                <p>The foundation is: Values are not code. Most values are immutable. Variables are pointers to values, are connected to values through ‘wires.’ Expressions are questions that JavaScript can answer. These answers are in the form of variables. </p>
                
                <h4>Chapter 5: The Primitive Values</h4>
                <p>I am appreciating the order this chapter is introducing these: in order of how many values there are of each primitive data type.</p>

                <p>Undefined has one and only one flavor of its value and that is undefined.  </p>
                
                <p>Null is similar.  Null does have the typeof quirk, but other than that the difference is more human related than machine related. The machine treats them the same. In regards to human it all has to do with intention. Undefined represents unintentionally missing values, whereas null represents intentionally missing values.</p>
                
                <p>Boolean values have two flavors: true and false. There are not multiple trues, nor are there multiple false. However each flavor can have infinite numbers of wires connecting them to different variables. </p>
                
                <p>Numbers. These have so many flavors. However the amount is not limited. Numbers also behave in quirky ways due to their floating-point nature. Their precision of reduces the further we get from 0. There are also special numbers: NaN, -Infinity, and Infinity, which exist to account for special circumstances.</p>
                
                <p>BigInts allow are arbitrary-precision integers. Not fully sure what that means, but it expands JavaScript’s numerical capabilities. These can be created by simply adding an ’n’ to the end of any integer. These are important when it comes to certain areas of finance.</p>
                
                <p>Strings have many flavors as well. Every character and pattern of characters represents a unique flavor of string. Based on our Inside JavaScript mental model, all strings already exist, we do not create them, but essentially summon them. Also strings have special properties that seem similar to those of arrays (objects), but these properties don’t behave exactly the same because strings are primitive and immutable.</p>
                
                <p>Symbols. These are not touched upon very much because they involve learning more about objects and so for now it is enough to know that they are similar to keys and they allows us to store/hide information inside an object and set what parts of the code can access that information.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Atomic Design</h3>
                <p>Finished the book today. The last 2 chapters were useful for giving me a good idea of what it’s like to work within a team environment in the industry.</p>

                <p>They weren’t too relevant to my current situation because most of the content was targeted towards someone who is currently working within a team and is wanting to implement design systems.</p>
                
                <p>My overall takeaway from this book is an appreciation for the design systems as whole and an excitement to implement them in my own projects.</p>
                
                <p>The design system approach feels more holistic and robust and it will become a part of my foundation as I move forward.</p>
                
                <p>I do wish there was more coverage on how to actually implement a pattern library. Chapter 3 did go over this somewhat, but it didn’t get into the details, which, to be fair, were most likely beyond the scope of the book itself. </p>
                
                <p>Things I want to learn more about going forward are how template languages work with data in the form of JSON to fill in component patterns with content.</p>
                
                <p>The most valuable chapters for me are chapters 2 and 3 and I will be revisiting these as I move forward. </p>
                
                <p>Moving forward I will also be utilizing companies’ style guides for inspiration and direction. Specifically I will be diving into Google’s Material. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts and Review: Atomic Design</h3>
                <p>Reviewing what I’ve learned so far in the Atomic Design course. </p>

                <p>Atoms are the simplest pieces. These are buttons, specific kinds of text (headers, descriptions, excerpts, paragraphs), specific kinds of images (profile pics, hero images, logos)</p>
                
                <p>Molecules are combinations of atoms to form larger functional pieces such as a search input with its search button.</p>
                
                <p>Organisms bring together molecules to form even more complex functional patterns consisting of combinations of atoms, molecules and even other organisms. Example would be a header which contains a navigation organism, a logo atom and a search molecule. </p>
                
                <p>Templates are how these things are brought together within a page. Templates are generic pages with generic content. These begin to give us an idea of how all the organisms come together to form an experience.</p>
                
                <p>Pages bring in the specific content to give a finished look. This is also the stage where we can really begin to test out variations in content, using test cases to wrinkle out any issues. </p>
                
                <p>How this is actually implemented within a design system involves file/directory structure, naming conventions for the files, templating languages, such as Mustache, testing data (can be in the form of JSON), the variations of data (default/filler, best case data, variation scenarios). </p>
                
                <p>This also involves documenting, annotating and providing component lineages. Documenting is about describing what each component, usually in the form of an organism or a molecule, is for, how it is to be used, and other details that can be helpful for designers and developers. Documentation also involves providing a means to view the code related to the component in all the necessary layers (template code, rendered html, css) and to see the finished result. </p>
                
                <p>Annotating is useful and is essentially a way to put the components within the context of an actual page and giving the capability to click on a button to reveal all the documentation related to the component itself.</p>
                
                <p>Documenting the component lineage is a part of documentation as well. This provides information on what atoms, molecules, organisms make up the component, as well as what organisms contain the component. It goes both downward and upward. This is useful for testing, troubleshooting and adjusting.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Atomic Design</h3>
                <p>Finished Chapter 4. This chapter broke down a potential workflow from idea to full implantation and how that looks in a non-linear/waterfall way.</p>

                <p>It started by going over the standard way of moving a project from ida to finished product, which is linear and how this doesn’t make sense in the environment of web development. </p>
                
                <p>My take aways from it: a project can be broken into 3 sections/teams (this is another abstracted layer): UX, Visual Design, and Front-End Development. These layers are in a constant dance with one another. </p>
                
                <p>For the UX, creating lo-fi sketches is more useful than full on mockups. It’s about creating the minimum viable product to create discussion.</p>
                
                <p>Visual designers can utilize a method called the 20 second gut check, which I think is pretty cool. It involves gathering a number of other similar sites, spending 20 secs looking at each and ranking them. After this, it’s about discussing the one’s that received low marks, high marks and the ones that received both low and high marks from different people. The next phase involves creating style tiles and elemental components.</p>
                
                <p>Front-end developers can start to set up project dependencies, get the file structure down, and begin marking up basic patterns so that early design ideas can be seen in the context of the web earlier. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Atomic Design</h3>

                <p>I finished chapter 3 and started in on chapter 4 of Atomic Design</p>

                <p>Chapter 3 gave me an overview of what a Pattern Library would look like when implemented. </p>
                
                <p>Pattern libraries consist of a file structure, naming conventions, template language (this one uses Mustache), data (this uses JSON), code views, documentation and annotations, and contextual documentation.</p>
                
                <p>I can see the power of and the beauty in creating systems that take all these into account. I am looking forward to implementing them.</p>
                
                <p>For some reason I get really excited about these kinds of systems. It is probably my OCD. </p>
                
                <p>Chapter 4 went over how to create buy-in for establishing a design system, which isn’t too relevant for me right now as I am not trying to sell this to anyone at the moment. I am already bought in to utilizing this. </p>
                
                <p>However this chapter was awesome at going over what good web design needs to take into account. Aspects such as being accessible within the limitations of a human and a device, layering enhancements based on form-factors and device capabilities, being future-friendly and able to take advantage of newer technology (watches, vehicles, smart glasses, etc).</p>

                <h3>Learning: Just Javascript</h3>

                <p><a href="https://justjavascript.com/">Just JavaScript</a> is a course that I purchased not too long ago. It is created by Dan Abramov and Maggie Appleton.</p>

                <p>It teaches the fundamentals of JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>I started it today and what follows are some thoughts about the 2 chapters I went through today.</p>
                
                <p>So far I am enjoying it very much.</p>

                <h4>Chapter One</h4>

                <p>This chapter is all about revealing the power of mental models. They exist whether we are aware of them or not. Becoming aware of them is important and foundational in being the best coder we can be.</p>

                <p>The chapter wraps mental models into the reality of the two speeds at which we think: fast and slow.</p>
                
                <p>Fast thinking involves patterned habitual, thinking and requires little energy. </p>
                
                <p>Slow thinking involves the ability to plan out, re- and de-structure, and take apart a process piece by piece to understand what is happening in order to make what we want to happen happen.</p>
                
                <p>Having accurate mental models is important for both fast thinking and slow thinking.</p>
                
                <p>Accurate mental models lead to less bugs and more efficient debugging. </p>
                
                <p>It is often the case that bugs arise when our fast thinking is based on inaccurate mental models. These bugs require us to enter into slow thinking mode. </p>
                
                <p>When we enter the more laborious slow thinking mode we can, if we are attentive, expose the flaws in our mental models as our mental model is what we are using to step through the process piece by piece. </p>
                
                <p>With the right mentality, bugs become opportunities for growth.</p>
                
                <h4>Chapter Two</h4>

                <p>This chapter was about values. </p>

                <p>The mental model of this chapter is: Values are not code.</p>
                
                <p>The concept that values are separate from code was one I haven’t encountered, but I think it is an important one. Our code is what moves values around and utilizes values. </p>
                
                <p>Values however are not dependent upon code. They exist whether there is code or not. They are the raw material waiting to be used. Like granite. It is there whether or not it is “programmed” into being a counter top. </p>
                
                <p>The elucidation of expressions was helpful as well. Expressions are questions that JavaScript can answer and the answer will always be in the form of a value. </p>
                
                <p>Values themselves come in 9 and only 9 types. There are two broad categories of values: primitive values and then objects and functions. It was made clear that functions are essentially types of objects, but they are special enough to warrant a pseudo-separation from objects. </p>
                
                <p>Primitive values are the most raw material and consist of numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbols, and bigints.</p>
                
                <p>Then there are objects and functions which are values, but can be interacted with uniquely using code. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Spent some time writing some more about the relationships of content, design and structure. I am finding this to be extremely helpful and grounding. All the learning that is to come will be rooted in better, more fertile soil due to having a better understanding of the context web design and development occurs within.</p>

                <p>I am coming to learn that I do have certain opinions. For instance, content itself needs to be the boss. Mostly. There is a lot of interplay between content, design, and structure, and yet there is also a main current that flows mostly in a certain direction. </p>
                
                <p>Design and structure should, for the most part be following the lead of content. Editing of content should be occurring outside of what colors and type it will be using and where and how it will be displayed. </p>
                
                <p>With that said, I know there are some books that had to be edited because the book itself needed to be shorter. In these cases structure is an editing factor on the content. But perhaps the structural needs only highlighted missed opportunities for creating more impactful content, forcing hard questions to be asked and darlings to be killed. In this sense structure didn’t necessarily do the editing, but rather created the impetus for improved editing.</p>
                
                <p>In this manner there is always bi-directional flow occurring, but for the most part content is king (or queen) and the flow is from content to design and structure.</p>
                
                <p>Content has a purpose and that purpose informs the style of voice that conveys the words. The purpose and voice are crucial factors when it comes to making design decisions. The color, textures, and typography need to support the purpose and voice of the content. There is simply no reason for this to have any back flow.</p>
                
                <p>Artistically, perhaps it could be fun to start with the limitation of using the color blue and letting that color’s psychological implications generate content. But for the most part this is not the case. </p>
                
                <p>When it comes to structure it gets interesting. There is an obvious connection between content and HTML semantic structure. The structure of the HTML will follow the structure of the content. </p>
                
                <p>But there are other structural aspects that aren’t necessarily dependent on the content itself, but rather are there to make sure that the content is flexibly visible and accessible. This involves external and internal layers.</p>
                
                <p>Externally, this means that the user is able to come into contact with the content. This contact must be able to occur within the majority of circumstances a user may find themselves. These circumstances are inherent to the user (blindness, deafness, motor impairment, etc.) and inherent to the device (screen sizes, interface differences, etc).</p>
                
                <p>Internally, this means that designers, developers and project managers are able to communicate with one another using a shared language that creates internal cohesion. This in turn would greatly benefit the stakeholders for what should be obvious reasons.  </p>
                
                <p>The flow between these internal and external structural layers is very much a bi-directional flow. Externally, users encountering the content will have positive and negative experiences. Negative experiences need to be eliminated and positive experiences need to be supported and enhanced.</p>
                
                <p>There is a lot of testing in this and when the factors involved in decreasing negative experiences and increasing positive experiences are discovered, there needs to be efficient ways to implement those discoveries. This is where internal structure in the form of design systems become crucial.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning </h3>
                <p>Started Chapter 3 of Atomic Design. This chapter is getting into how to actually implement a Pattern Library system. The author has created his own system which can be used called <a href="https://patternlab.io/" target="_blank">Pattern Lab</a>.</p>

                <p>For now I am more interested is how this system is implemented than in using Pattern Lab itself.</p>
                
                <p>I enjoyed learning about the file structure and how the Mustache template library is used to implement the mental model of atoms, molecules and organisms. </p>
                
                <p>Learned about the importance of having layers of test data in the process. There is the the default data such as images that are essentially block of color with the dimension indicated for the image, then there is the test data which is a specific test instance with an actual image and actual text (not lorem ipsum). Then, to take a step further it is about creating other test cases that reveal the extremes of the ;layout, which really helps to weed out issues. </p>
                
                <p>The takeaways from today: project file structure, use of templating language, use of JSON for data test cases and how to implement layers of data throughout the process. I am really looking forward to implementing this in practice. </p>
                
                <p>I will finish this chapter tomorrow and perhaps even chapter 4.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Once I get my “system” of learning up and running fully Sunday’s will usually be my day off, fully. However today I have the desire to keep on keeping’ on for now. It doesn’t seem like work. It brings me joy.</p>

                <p>Today I further refined the distillations from yesterday. The biggest thing that fell into place for me is how modular design is linked to and informs the visual design (thinking about the idea that is Elemental Components). </p>
                
                <p>My rough diagram of how content gets styled and structured is becoming more delineated. There is a definite flow of well structured content into a design system. Now, I do realized there is always a sort of ebb and flow between all the processes in regards to structuring and styling content. It’s one of those Chicken and the Egg paradigms. </p>
                
                <p>Well-structured content  > Design System > Visual Design and Modular Design > Responsive layout and structure > Pattern Libraries. </p>
                
                <p>It seems to feed down into less abstraction, which then feeds back up through the more abstract layers. There is a constant motion between these  poles, moving from general to specific and back again. </p>

                <h3>Coding Journal Project Setup</h3>
                <p>This coding journal is meant to be a sort of daily (except Sundays, usually) place where I keep tabs on what the hell I am doing.</p>

                <p>This will also be a perfect means for me to practice design systems to a certain extent.</p>
                
                <p>I have a website setup at <a href="https://christhe.dev/" target="_blank">ChrisThe.Dev</a> and this journal is going to be the main content of it for now.</p>
                
                <p>I got this set up on the server and got some practice with pulling from GitHub as I am bouncing between a couple computers right now. This is good practice. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning </h3>
                <p>Today I went through chapter 2 of Atomic Design. I am really loving this book so far. It is also confirming of a lot of the thoughts I have been having lately. Many times I would see words and phrases used in the book that I myself have used. It’s just nice to see that.</p>

                <p>Here’s a distillation of chapter 2:</p>
                
                <p>Loving the mental model of using chemistry. This not only makes sense to me, but resonates with me in regards to involving models that represent natural phenomenon that are already well-established. This is called leverage and leverage is one of the core reasons why programming exists in the first place. Plus, I love chemistry. </p>
                
                <p>We have atoms, molecules, and organisms. These build upon each other logically. They also help inform one another.</p>
                
                <p>As we move up in complexity we start to enter into context. Atoms are outside of context, but combine to form context in the form of molecules, which combine to form a more solid context in the form of organisms. </p>
                
                <p>Once we move beyond organisms we then leave behind the chemistry model and enter into the context of the web itself. It starts with templates which is page dependent, but content independent and then it moves to pages which are content dependent.</p>
                
                <p>This is a progression from general to specific. Context evolves as the process moves forward and as we reach the most specific point we get to see how the atoms, molecules and organisms are serving there purpose. If something isn’t working we have the benefit of being able to make an informed decision regarding the level that the issue needs to be addressed. </p>
                
                <p>I am excited to learn more of this. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>No learning today; this was a day of consolidating what I learned yesterday when reading the first chapter of Atomic Design. I created a distillation of the learnings.</p>

                <p>This allowed me to get a better grip on how design systems work and how there are decreasing layers of abstraction.</p>
                
                <p>I think I am going to make Saturdays a consolidation day. A day of refining and revisiting the week’s learnings and potentially the day where I create a legitimate article is either published or at the point of being ready to publish. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>I spent a lot of time over the last few days creating a plan for how I will pursue my learning. </p>

                <p>I am learning that there is only so much planning that can be done and that I have reached that limit. It is an organic process of checking and changing. Make the plan, then do because the doing reveals a lot of information that will help further flesh out the plan and, most importantly, tie it to reality.</p>
                
                <p>The plan, for now, is structured into Learning, Building, Networking and Contributing, and Writing. </p>
                
                <p>I have learned that the Writing component is built into Learning and Building via the creation of writings.</p>
                
                <p>The writing occurs in stages. Most of the writing is for my own understanding. The writing is sloppy at first, just writing whatever comes to mind, but this gives me material to structure and potentially craft into an article. I make the block of stone and then I carve out David… at least that’s the dream haha!</p>
                
                <p>Writing is also built into Networking and Contributing via sharing the writings that are created, as well as sharing the knowledge gained through writing, which helps with my understanding. </p>
                
                <p>The purpose of writing is to concretize my understanding. It is the same concept as Rubber Duck Debugging. </p>

                <h3>Learnings</h3>
                <p>Today I started reading Atomic Design by Brad Frost. I read the first chapter and learned of the importance of design systems. I also learned about the limitations of using design apps such as Photoshop when it comes to building websites. I find that making this limitation explicit actually makes these apps more useful. </p>

                <p>I spent a good deal of time writing about what I learned. Trying to figure out a better way to distill this. The distilling is challenging for me currently, but the challenge is fun. It forces me to think about some logical flow. Plus it is the distilled writings that I will ultimately be able to offer to others as a form of contribution.</p>
