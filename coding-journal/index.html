                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Once I get my “system” of learning up and running fully Sunday’s will usually be my day off, fully. However today I have the desire to keep on keeping’ on for now. It doesn’t seem like work. It brings me joy.</p>

                <p>Today I further refined the distillations from yesterday. The biggest thing that fell into place for me is how modular design is linked to and informs the visual design (thinking about the idea that is Elemental Components). </p>
                
                <p>My rough diagram of how content gets styled and structured is becoming more delineated. There is a definite flow of well structured content into a design system. Now, I do realized there is always a sort of ebb and flow between all the processes in regards to structuring and styling content. It’s one of those Chicken and the Egg paradigms. </p>
                
                <p>Well-structured content  > Design System > Visual Design and Modular Design > Responsive layout and structure > Pattern Libraries. </p>
                
                <p>It seems to feed down into less abstraction, which then feeds back up through the more abstract layers. There is a constant motion between these  poles, moving from general to specific and back again. </p>

                <h3>Coding Journal Project Setup</h3>
                <p>This coding journal is meant to be a sort of daily (except Sundays, usually) place where I keep tabs on what the hell I am doing.</p>

                <p>This will also be a perfect means for me to practice design systems to a certain extent.</p>
                
                <p>I have a website setup at <a href="https://christhe.dev/" target="_blank">ChrisThe.Dev</a> and this journal is going to be the main content of it for now.</p>
                
                <p>I got this set up on the server and got some practice with pulling from GitHub as I am bouncing between a couple computers right now. This is good practice. </p>
                
                <h3>Distillation of the Learning </h3>
                <p>Today I went through chapter 2 of Atomic Design. I am really loving this book so far. It is also confirming of a lot of the thoughts I have been having lately. Many times I would see words and phrases used in the book that I myself have used. It’s just nice to see that.</p>

                <p>Here’s a distillation of chapter 2:</p>
                
                <p>Loving the mental model of using chemistry. This not only makes sense to me, but resonates with me in regards to involving models that represent natural phenomenon that are already well-established. This is called leverage and leverage is one of the core reasons why programming exists in the first place. Plus, I love chemistry. </p>
                
                <p>We have atoms, molecules, and organisms. These build upon each other logically. They also help inform one another.</p>
                
                <p>As we move up in complexity we start to enter into context. Atoms are outside of context, but combine to form context in the form of molecules, which combine to form a more solid context in the form of organisms. </p>
                
                <p>Once we move beyond organisms we then leave behind the chemistry model and enter into the context of the web itself. It starts with templates which is page dependent, but content independent and then it moves to pages which are content dependent.</p>
                
                <p>This is a progression from general to specific. Context evolves as the process moves forward and as we reach the most specific point we get to see how the atoms, molecules and organisms are serving there purpose. If something isn’t working we have the benefit of being able to make an informed decision regarding the level that the issue needs to be addressed. </p>
                
                <p>I am excited to learn more of this. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>No learning today; this was a day of consolidating what I learned yesterday when reading the first chapter of Atomic Design. I created a distillation of the learnings.</p>

                <p>This allowed me to get a better grip on how design systems work and how there are decreasing layers of abstraction.</p>
                
                <p>I think I am going to make Saturdays a consolidation day. A day of refining and revisiting the week’s learnings and potentially the day where I create a legitimate article is either published or at the point of being ready to publish. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>I spent a lot of time over the last few days creating a plan for how I will pursue my learning. </p>

                <p>I am learning that there is only so much planning that can be done and that I have reached that limit. It is an organic process of checking and changing. Make the plan, then do because the doing reveals a lot of information that will help further flesh out the plan and, most importantly, tie it to reality.</p>
                
                <p>The plan, for now, is structured into Learning, Building, Networking and Contributing, and Writing. </p>
                
                <p>I have learned that the Writing component is built into Learning and Building via the creation of writings.</p>
                
                <p>The writing occurs in stages. Most of the writing is for my own understanding. The writing is sloppy at first, just writing whatever comes to mind, but this gives me material to structure and potentially craft into an article. I make the block of stone and then I carve out David… at least that’s the dream haha!</p>
                
                <p>Writing is also built into Networking and Contributing via sharing the writings that are created, as well as sharing the knowledge gained through writing, which helps with my understanding. </p>
                
                <p>The purpose of writing is to concretize my understanding. It is the same concept as Rubber Duck Debugging. </p>

                <h3>Learnings</h3>
                <p>Today I started reading Atomic Design by Brad Frost. I read the first chapter and learned of the importance of design systems. I also learned about the limitations of using design apps such as Photoshop when it comes to building websites. I find that making this limitation explicit actually makes these apps more useful. </p>

                <p>I spent a good deal of time writing about what I learned. Trying to figure out a better way to distill this. The distilling is challenging for me currently, but the challenge is fun. It forces me to think about some logical flow. Plus it is the distilled writings that I will ultimately be able to offer to others as a form of contribution.</p>
