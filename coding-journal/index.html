                <h3>Thoughts and Review: Atomic Design</h3>
                <p>Reviewing what I’ve learned so far in the Atomic Design course. </p>

                <p>Atoms are the simplest pieces. These are buttons, specific kinds of text (headers, descriptions, excerpts, paragraphs), specific kinds of images (profile pics, hero images, logos)</p>
                
                <p>Molecules are combinations of atoms to form larger functional pieces such as a search input with its search button.</p>
                
                <p>Organisms bring together molecules to form even more complex functional patterns consisting of combinations of atoms, molecules and even other organisms. Example would be a header which contains a navigation organism, a logo atom and a search molecule. </p>
                
                <p>Templates are how these things are brought together within a page. Templates are generic pages with generic content. These begin to give us an idea of how all the organisms come together to form an experience.</p>
                
                <p>Pages bring in the specific content to give a finished look. This is also the stage where we can really begin to test out variations in content, using test cases to wrinkle out any issues. </p>
                
                <p>How this is actually implemented within a design system involves file/directory structure, naming conventions for the files, templating languages, such as Mustache, testing data (can be in the form of JSON), the variations of data (default/filler, best case data, variation scenarios). </p>
                
                <p>This also involves documenting, annotating and providing component lineages. Documenting is about describing what each component, usually in the form of an organism or a molecule, is for, how it is to be used, and other details that can be helpful for designers and developers. Documentation also involves providing a means to view the code related to the component in all the necessary layers (template code, rendered html, css) and to see the finished result. </p>
                
                <p>Annotating is useful and is essentially a way to put the components within the context of an actual page and giving the capability to click on a button to reveal all the documentation related to the component itself.</p>
                
                <p>Documenting the component lineage is a part of documentation as well. This provides information on what atoms, molecules, organisms make up the component, as well as what organisms contain the component. It goes both downward and upward. This is useful for testing, troubleshooting and adjusting.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Atomic Design</h3>
                <p>Finished Chapter 4. This chapter broke down a potential workflow from idea to full implantation and how that looks in a non-linear/waterfall way.</p>

                <p>It started by going over the standard way of moving a project from ida to finished product, which is linear and how this doesn’t make sense in the environment of web development. </p>
                
                <p>My take aways from it: a project can be broken into 3 sections/teams (this is another abstracted layer): UX, Visual Design, and Front-End Development. These layers are in a constant dance with one another. </p>
                
                <p>For the UX, creating lo-fi sketches is more useful than full on mockups. It’s about creating the minimum viable product to create discussion.</p>
                
                <p>Visual designers can utilize a method called the 20 second gut check, which I think is pretty cool. It involves gathering a number of other similar sites, spending 20 secs looking at each and ranking them. After this, it’s about discussing the one’s that received low marks, high marks and the ones that received both low and high marks from different people. The next phase involves creating style tiles and elemental components.</p>
                
                <p>Front-end developers can start to set up project dependencies, get the file structure down, and begin marking up basic patterns so that early design ideas can be seen in the context of the web earlier. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Atomic Design</h3>

                <p>I finished chapter 3 and started in on chapter 4 of Atomic Design</p>

                <p>Chapter 3 gave me an overview of what a Pattern Library would look like when implemented. </p>
                
                <p>Pattern libraries consist of a file structure, naming conventions, template language (this one uses Mustache), data (this uses JSON), code views, documentation and annotations, and contextual documentation.</p>
                
                <p>I can see the power of and the beauty in creating systems that take all these into account. I am looking forward to implementing them.</p>
                
                <p>For some reason I get really excited about these kinds of systems. It is probably my OCD. </p>
                
                <p>Chapter 4 went over how to create buy-in for establishing a design system, which isn’t too relevant for me right now as I am not trying to sell this to anyone at the moment. I am already bought in to utilizing this. </p>
                
                <p>However this chapter was awesome at going over what good web design needs to take into account. Aspects such as being accessible within the limitations of a human and a device, layering enhancements based on form-factors and device capabilities, being future-friendly and able to take advantage of newer technology (watches, vehicles, smart glasses, etc).</p>

                <h3>Learning: Just Javascript</h3>

                <p><a href="https://justjavascript.com/">Just JavaScript</a> is a course that I purchased not too long ago. It is created by Dan Abramov and Maggie Appleton.</p>

                <p>It teaches the fundamentals of JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>I started it today and what follows are some thoughts about the 2 chapters I went through today.</p>
                
                <p>So far I am enjoying it very much.</p>

                <h4>Chapter One</h4>

                <p>This chapter is all about revealing the power of mental models. They exist whether we are aware of them or not. Becoming aware of them is important and foundational in being the best coder we can be.</p>

                <p>The chapter wraps mental models into the reality of the two speeds at which we think: fast and slow.</p>
                
                <p>Fast thinking involves patterned habitual, thinking and requires little energy. </p>
                
                <p>Slow thinking involves the ability to plan out, re- and de-structure, and take apart a process piece by piece to understand what is happening in order to make what we want to happen happen.</p>
                
                <p>Having accurate mental models is important for both fast thinking and slow thinking.</p>
                
                <p>Accurate mental models lead to less bugs and more efficient debugging. </p>
                
                <p>It is often the case that bugs arise when our fast thinking is based on inaccurate mental models. These bugs require us to enter into slow thinking mode. </p>
                
                <p>When we enter the more laborious slow thinking mode we can, if we are attentive, expose the flaws in our mental models as our mental model is what we are using to step through the process piece by piece. </p>
                
                <p>With the right mentality, bugs become opportunities for growth.</p>
                
                <h4>Chapter Two</h4>

                <p>This chapter was about values. </p>

                <p>The mental model of this chapter is: Values are not code.</p>
                
                <p>The concept that values are separate from code was one I haven’t encountered, but I think it is an important one. Our code is what moves values around and utilizes values. </p>
                
                <p>Values however are not dependent upon code. They exist whether there is code or not. They are the raw material waiting to be used. Like granite. It is there whether or not it is “programmed” into being a counter top. </p>
                
                <p>The elucidation of expressions was helpful as well. Expressions are questions that JavaScript can answer and the answer will always be in the form of a value. </p>
                
                <p>Values themselves come in 9 and only 9 types. There are two broad categories of values: primitive values and then objects and functions. It was made clear that functions are essentially types of objects, but they are special enough to warrant a pseudo-separation from objects. </p>
                
                <p>Primitive values are the most raw material and consist of numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbols, and bigints.</p>
                
                <p>Then there are objects and functions which are values, but can be interacted with uniquely using code. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Spent some time writing some more about the relationships of content, design and structure. I am finding this to be extremely helpful and grounding. All the learning that is to come will be rooted in better, more fertile soil due to having a better understanding of the context web design and development occurs within.</p>

                <p>I am coming to learn that I do have certain opinions. For instance, content itself needs to be the boss. Mostly. There is a lot of interplay between content, design, and structure, and yet there is also a main current that flows mostly in a certain direction. </p>
                
                <p>Design and structure should, for the most part be following the lead of content. Editing of content should be occurring outside of what colors and type it will be using and where and how it will be displayed. </p>
                
                <p>With that said, I know there are some books that had to be edited because the book itself needed to be shorter. In these cases structure is an editing factor on the content. But perhaps the structural needs only highlighted missed opportunities for creating more impactful content, forcing hard questions to be asked and darlings to be killed. In this sense structure didn’t necessarily do the editing, but rather created the impetus for improved editing.</p>
                
                <p>In this manner there is always bi-directional flow occurring, but for the most part content is king (or queen) and the flow is from content to design and structure.</p>
                
                <p>Content has a purpose and that purpose informs the style of voice that conveys the words. The purpose and voice are crucial factors when it comes to making design decisions. The color, textures, and typography need to support the purpose and voice of the content. There is simply no reason for this to have any back flow.</p>
                
                <p>Artistically, perhaps it could be fun to start with the limitation of using the color blue and letting that color’s psychological implications generate content. But for the most part this is not the case. </p>
                
                <p>When it comes to structure it gets interesting. There is an obvious connection between content and HTML semantic structure. The structure of the HTML will follow the structure of the content. </p>
                
                <p>But there are other structural aspects that aren’t necessarily dependent on the content itself, but rather are there to make sure that the content is flexibly visible and accessible. This involves external and internal layers.</p>
                
                <p>Externally, this means that the user is able to come into contact with the content. This contact must be able to occur within the majority of circumstances a user may find themselves. These circumstances are inherent to the user (blindness, deafness, motor impairment, etc.) and inherent to the device (screen sizes, interface differences, etc).</p>
                
                <p>Internally, this means that designers, developers and project managers are able to communicate with one another using a shared language that creates internal cohesion. This in turn would greatly benefit the stakeholders for what should be obvious reasons.  </p>
                
                <p>The flow between these internal and external structural layers is very much a bi-directional flow. Externally, users encountering the content will have positive and negative experiences. Negative experiences need to be eliminated and positive experiences need to be supported and enhanced.</p>
                
                <p>There is a lot of testing in this and when the factors involved in decreasing negative experiences and increasing positive experiences are discovered, there needs to be efficient ways to implement those discoveries. This is where internal structure in the form of design systems become crucial.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning </h3>
                <p>Started Chapter 3 of Atomic Design. This chapter is getting into how to actually implement a Pattern Library system. The author has created his own system which can be used called <a href="https://patternlab.io/" target="_blank">Pattern Lab</a>.</p>

                <p>For now I am more interested is how this system is implemented than in using Pattern Lab itself.</p>
                
                <p>I enjoyed learning about the file structure and how the Mustache template library is used to implement the mental model of atoms, molecules and organisms. </p>
                
                <p>Learned about the importance of having layers of test data in the process. There is the the default data such as images that are essentially block of color with the dimension indicated for the image, then there is the test data which is a specific test instance with an actual image and actual text (not lorem ipsum). Then, to take a step further it is about creating other test cases that reveal the extremes of the ;layout, which really helps to weed out issues. </p>
                
                <p>The takeaways from today: project file structure, use of templating language, use of JSON for data test cases and how to implement layers of data throughout the process. I am really looking forward to implementing this in practice. </p>
                
                <p>I will finish this chapter tomorrow and perhaps even chapter 4.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Once I get my “system” of learning up and running fully Sunday’s will usually be my day off, fully. However today I have the desire to keep on keeping’ on for now. It doesn’t seem like work. It brings me joy.</p>

                <p>Today I further refined the distillations from yesterday. The biggest thing that fell into place for me is how modular design is linked to and informs the visual design (thinking about the idea that is Elemental Components). </p>
                
                <p>My rough diagram of how content gets styled and structured is becoming more delineated. There is a definite flow of well structured content into a design system. Now, I do realized there is always a sort of ebb and flow between all the processes in regards to structuring and styling content. It’s one of those Chicken and the Egg paradigms. </p>
                
                <p>Well-structured content  > Design System > Visual Design and Modular Design > Responsive layout and structure > Pattern Libraries. </p>
                
                <p>It seems to feed down into less abstraction, which then feeds back up through the more abstract layers. There is a constant motion between these  poles, moving from general to specific and back again. </p>

                <h3>Coding Journal Project Setup</h3>
                <p>This coding journal is meant to be a sort of daily (except Sundays, usually) place where I keep tabs on what the hell I am doing.</p>

                <p>This will also be a perfect means for me to practice design systems to a certain extent.</p>
                
                <p>I have a website setup at <a href="https://christhe.dev/" target="_blank">ChrisThe.Dev</a> and this journal is going to be the main content of it for now.</p>
                
                <p>I got this set up on the server and got some practice with pulling from GitHub as I am bouncing between a couple computers right now. This is good practice. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning </h3>
                <p>Today I went through chapter 2 of Atomic Design. I am really loving this book so far. It is also confirming of a lot of the thoughts I have been having lately. Many times I would see words and phrases used in the book that I myself have used. It’s just nice to see that.</p>

                <p>Here’s a distillation of chapter 2:</p>
                
                <p>Loving the mental model of using chemistry. This not only makes sense to me, but resonates with me in regards to involving models that represent natural phenomenon that are already well-established. This is called leverage and leverage is one of the core reasons why programming exists in the first place. Plus, I love chemistry. </p>
                
                <p>We have atoms, molecules, and organisms. These build upon each other logically. They also help inform one another.</p>
                
                <p>As we move up in complexity we start to enter into context. Atoms are outside of context, but combine to form context in the form of molecules, which combine to form a more solid context in the form of organisms. </p>
                
                <p>Once we move beyond organisms we then leave behind the chemistry model and enter into the context of the web itself. It starts with templates which is page dependent, but content independent and then it moves to pages which are content dependent.</p>
                
                <p>This is a progression from general to specific. Context evolves as the process moves forward and as we reach the most specific point we get to see how the atoms, molecules and organisms are serving there purpose. If something isn’t working we have the benefit of being able to make an informed decision regarding the level that the issue needs to be addressed. </p>
                
                <p>I am excited to learn more of this. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>No learning today; this was a day of consolidating what I learned yesterday when reading the first chapter of Atomic Design. I created a distillation of the learnings.</p>

                <p>This allowed me to get a better grip on how design systems work and how there are decreasing layers of abstraction.</p>
                
                <p>I think I am going to make Saturdays a consolidation day. A day of refining and revisiting the week’s learnings and potentially the day where I create a legitimate article is either published or at the point of being ready to publish. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>I spent a lot of time over the last few days creating a plan for how I will pursue my learning. </p>

                <p>I am learning that there is only so much planning that can be done and that I have reached that limit. It is an organic process of checking and changing. Make the plan, then do because the doing reveals a lot of information that will help further flesh out the plan and, most importantly, tie it to reality.</p>
                
                <p>The plan, for now, is structured into Learning, Building, Networking and Contributing, and Writing. </p>
                
                <p>I have learned that the Writing component is built into Learning and Building via the creation of writings.</p>
                
                <p>The writing occurs in stages. Most of the writing is for my own understanding. The writing is sloppy at first, just writing whatever comes to mind, but this gives me material to structure and potentially craft into an article. I make the block of stone and then I carve out David… at least that’s the dream haha!</p>
                
                <p>Writing is also built into Networking and Contributing via sharing the writings that are created, as well as sharing the knowledge gained through writing, which helps with my understanding. </p>
                
                <p>The purpose of writing is to concretize my understanding. It is the same concept as Rubber Duck Debugging. </p>

                <h3>Learnings</h3>
                <p>Today I started reading Atomic Design by Brad Frost. I read the first chapter and learned of the importance of design systems. I also learned about the limitations of using design apps such as Photoshop when it comes to building websites. I find that making this limitation explicit actually makes these apps more useful. </p>

                <p>I spent a good deal of time writing about what I learned. Trying to figure out a better way to distill this. The distilling is challenging for me currently, but the challenge is fun. It forces me to think about some logical flow. Plus it is the distilled writings that I will ultimately be able to offer to others as a form of contribution.</p>
