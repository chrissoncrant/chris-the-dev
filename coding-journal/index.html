                <h3>Learning and Building: Whitespace, escape characters, etc.</h3>
                <p>Yesterday I learned so much more about how text is translated between layers. There is still some fuzziness, but my understanding has improved enough for now. </p>
                
                <p>At this point I want to simply wrap up yesterday’s reference project.</p>
                
                <p>Quick review for my sake:</p>
                <p>In JS, strings are essentially one long line of characters with spaces, tabs and new lines being characters as well. It’s easy to forget that emptiness and the characteristic of that kind of emptiness also make up characters.</p>
                
                <p>Characters like ‘\n’ are telling the computer how to display the string. Layout has everything to do with space. These characters are mini-functions. They are called escape characters. </p>
                
                <p>Console logging a JS string that contains these escape characters will show the proper space in place of the character. In order to have the front-end webpage do this, the default behavior needs to be changed. </p>
                
                <p>The front-end has its own way of parsing strings. These strings come from the content of the HTML element. </p>
                
                <p>It will ignore extra new lines or spaces. New lines are essentially determined by the container. Text hits container wall, a new line is created. No need for any other extra attention to be paid to any escape characters.</p>
                
                <p>Question:</p>
                <p>How does an escape character inserted directly into HTML differ from an escape character inserted by JS?</p>
                
                <p>It must be that the JS escape characters get parsed and converted into HTML entities. For example, when HTML receives a JS string that has ‘\n’ there must be something that converts it to ‘&amp;#10;’ which is the corresponding HTML entity.</p>
                
                <p>Even when using certain HTML entities, like the new line entity, whether or not it does anything on the webpage is determined by the value of white-space.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>It’s interesting… representing nothing with something. It’s interesting how nothing itself can have different flavors (spaces, tabs, new lines). These nothings need to be represented somehow to give their nothingness a somethingness. The somethingness of the nothings is only explicit when there are soemthings (visible symbols, like letters) surrounding it. Without the nothings, the meaning of the somethings would be lost, would be noise, all jumbled together. The nothings and the somethings work together to uphold the value of one another. With that said it is cleaner, lighter, more potent to have nothing without somethings, than to have a lot of somethings without nothing. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>I really don’t know when it would be useful to format text within an HTML document or within a JS string. Moving on.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: ChatGPT Tutorial Project #1</h3>
                <p>It is well past time to finished this tutorial. I can see clearly now just how ChatGPT’s response is packaged thanks to the time I spent researching and exploring the white-space property. </p>
                
                <p>I spent some time exploring the how to craft ChatGPT prompts. This is an art in an of itself. How best to use words to have a machine do what I want. </p>
                
                <p>This is what coding is. It is the art of getting a machine to accurately do what we want. Now, with ChatGPT, the words/symbols/characters we use to tell the machine what to do are words that are familiar to us.</p>
                
                <p>Still, clear communication is important. Yes the words are in a familiar syntax (i.e. English), but what words to use and in what order is important.</p>
                
                <p>What’s interesting is that by learing to communicate with the machine using my language, it forces me to hone my language usage. Now all those english classes and writing exercises and reading and engaging with words in general can pay off in new and wild ways. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>This tutorial introduced me to 3 tools that I am glad I know exist now.</p>
                
                <p>The first is Vite. This is the client-side packaging of the front end. I am not sure quite what it does, like specifically… will look into this further tomorrow.</p>
                
                <p>The second is <a href="http://render.com" target="_blank">render.com</a>. What a cool tool. This is for back-end deployment. With this I can now spin up a remotely accessed server really easy-like. Before I had to go into AWS to create. I can do it, but I’d have to look up the instructions again.</p>
                
                <p>This site makes it super easy. I don’t know what the costs are like, but it allows me to start for free.</p>
                
                <p>The third tool is <a href="http://vercel.com" target="_blank">vercel.com</a>. This is the front-end deployment tool. This gives us a URL for the front-end, which will be talking with the back-end (thanks to <a href="http://render.com" target="_blank">render.com</a>). </p>
                
                <p>This is where I leave off with this for today. Tomorrow I will continue breaking down this project for the meta-processes. I think it would be helpful to make a diagram of all the tools (Vite, Nodejs, GitHub, Vercel, Render) and their purpose. Will be fun!</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters/The New Hard Parts</h3>
                <p>More thinking on async JS.</p>
                
                <p>I have some code that needs to run when something happens. I don’t know when that something will happen, but when it does happen I need some other things to happen. But only when the first something happens. </p>
                
                <p>What the Fetch API does is sets up a listener and assigns functions to run in a specific order. </p>
                
                <p>The things that need to happen occur within the browser itself. The callstack() is free, not blocked by this process. The process finishes, that has a result, this result triggers the other functions to run.</p>
                
                <p>It’s that whole setting up a listener thing. It’s that whole moving long processes outside of JavaScript as much as possible and tying JavaScript code to run. Asynchronous happenings within a synchronous environment. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>I am seeing now that for the most part, we don’t want any tasks that take a long time to occur within JavaScript. We want to keep that callstack() open and responsive to do what it needs to do. </p>
                
                <p>The most common form of long-running processes that we want to keep out of JS land is the HTTP request. Depending on the request and distance to server, server traffic handling capacity (bandwidth?), the time it takes is highl variable. HTTP requests are always open ended where time is concerned.</p>
                
                <p>This process occurs outside JavaScript, within the runtime environment. The runtime (browser, nodejs, etc) is packaging, parsing, serializing/deserializing, making the network connect, sending/receiving the request/response. This task takes a certain amount of time. While its doing its thing, we don’t want JavaScript to be hung up waiting for the result.</p>
                
                <p>Fetch is an API that allows us to make HTTP requests (utilize the runtime’s network feature), attach functions and error handling to the response, and when the response is completed, auto-run those functions based on the response. And ultimately it allows us to keep the callstack() free and open while this happens.</p>

                <h2>Learning: Whitespace, escape characters, serialization-desierialization, etc.</h2>
                <p>I want to spend at least another hour today studying a bit more into how text works when coding. I feel like this is important, especially when it comes to interacting with APIs. </p>
                
                <p>To start this exploration I just wrote out a quick note to myself of the different variables (white-space property, regular strings, template literal strings, HTML text format, JavaScript text format).</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>There is the front-end consumer of the information. How the information is displayed plays a key role in information absorption and human energy expenditure (ability to concentrate).</p>
                
                <p>Much of this formatting is set up automatically based on the HTML element. This is also altered using CSS.</p>
                
                <p>Then there’s the developer. That text that’s on the screen is also in the HTML document. The formatting of the text within the HTML document may or may not affect how it is displayed on the front end. </p>
                
                <p>By default, the white-space and text formatting that occurs within the HTML document code is ignored. This behavior is altered by CSS and also by using the <pre> element. </p>
                
                <p>Text moves from HTML to web page. But text can also move into HTML from JavaScript. </p>
                
                <p>With JavaScript one can insert text into an element. This means that what JS in isnerting is meant to be seen on the front end. </p>
                
                <p>With JS, one can also insert new HTML into the HTML document. This is structure. Along with this, text is usually inserted into the created elements as well.</p>
                
                <p>When inserting HTML and text into an HTML document from JS, when does formatting of the text matter?</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>As for escaping characters, the types of characters that need to be escaped depends on the context within which that character occurs and whether or not there is additional meaning programmed into it within that context. If there is additional meaning, then that character needs to be escaped. </p>
                
                <p>Each context has its own means of escaping. In JS, there’s the \. In HTML, there’s a number of escape sequences.</p>
                
                <p>I never realized this in this way with such clarity. It seems so obvious, but without me actually putting it into concrete words, it was blurry.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>So in the HTML document, within an element, I can type \n, \b, \r without any conflicts. HTML doesn’t care about the ‘\’ character. It is just a character to it. It will display.</p>
                
                <p>However, within JavaScript, if I create a string and want to use the ‘\’ character, or if I want the string itself to contain ‘\n’, then I must escape the ‘\’. This is because JS has an extra in-built meaning to the ‘\’ itself. If I don’t escape the ‘\’ JS will utilize its functionality within the string.</p>
                
                <p>Let’s say I have a passage that contains a number of paragraphs. If, on the front-end, I wanted the paragraphs to be separated by line breaks I could do this in a number of ways. </p>
                
                <p>The most basic level, is statically adding the paragraphs into the HTML document, putting each paragraph into a paragraph element. Paragraph elements are block elements and so there would be a percieved line break. In the HTML document itself, the white-space formatting would not need to be taken into account.</p>
                
                <p>Another way to accomplish this would be to insert to text into the HTML wrapped in a <pre> tag and format the text appropriately. The problem with this approach is control. All the control for formatting comes from within the HTML document itself. Or within the JS file that is inserting the text onto the HTML element. This is best left to CSS.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>I created a simple white-space refererence project. It has examples of each of the property values that the <code>white-space</code> CSS decalartion uses. This did help me with understanding what is going on in regards to how text is displayed, how escape characters work and that they vary with context. </p>
                
                <p>One article I read mentioned how the <code>white-space</code> declaration deals with new lines, spaces and tabs, and text-wrapping. </p>
                
                <p>These aspects are so fundamental to computer programming, but easily overlooked. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p> The only way you can display formatted text that has been sent to HTML via Javascript, is if that HTML element has a white-space property declared on it, other than the default ‘normal’ value. </p>
                
                <p>The reason this is, is that normally, all extra new line, space, and tab characters are ignored. Other white-space values take these characters into consideration, as well as wrapping. </p>
                
                <p>Template literals have implied line break, space, and tab characters. Whereas with string literals, a \n must be used to indicate a line break, template literals will insert the \n characters for us based on how the string is formatted. </p>
                
                <pre><code>let stringLiteral = "\n\n\n";
                
                //3 returns, literally:
                let templateLiteral = `
                
                
                `;
                
                //logs true
                console.log(stringLiteral === templateLiteral); </code></pre>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>When the string is added to HTML, these characters are there, and whether or not they have any impact on how the text looks on the front-end depends on CSS declarations, such white-space. </p>

                <p>I am getting an annoying behavior in VSCode. I have a node<i>modules folder, which is ignored via the .gitignore file, but the node</i>modules is highlighted in blue, and therefore the entire project folder is highlighted in blue. It is successfully ignored as I can see there are no commits, but the blue color makes me cranky. Makes it seem like there’s something that needs to be done.</p>

                <p>To test this behavior, I created a new directory. Added the .gitignore file first, git init, npm init, installed express and cors (for the sake of example), added another directory and added it to .gitignore as well. Here, the ignored folders show up as blue, but the main project directory does not show in blue.</p>
                
                <p>Created another project. Did the same thing, only this time I added the .gitignore after npm init and installing packages to see if there is a difference. </p>
                
                <p>What are the factors here (no specific order here, just listing):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>git init a project folder
                    </li>
                    <li>add .gitignore file
                        <ul>
                            <li> .gitignore file is irrelevant without a project being git initialized, so it makes sense to initialize
                                first
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>npm init
                        <ul>
                            <li> This simply adds a package.json file
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>npm install packages
                        <ul>
                            <li> This is when the node_modules folder gets introduced.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>making the first git commit
                        <ul>
                            <li> at what time in the process, before or after?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>So , the solution seems to be simply closing the VSCode window and reopening it. Dumb. However I am grateful for it becuase it invited the opportunity to revisit this fundamental process of setting up a project and thinking about things that are important.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: ChatGPT Project</h3>
                <p>Spending some time talking through the back-end code, using techical communication. Doing what I can to make it more natural. </p>
                
                <p>After getting to the line where I use <code>process.env.SECRET</code> I was led to explore the ‘process’ global object in Node.js a bit more. I limited myself to 5 minutes of this, to stay on task.</p>
                
                <p>I continued on with talking myself through the back-end code. This led me to talk thorugh what is actually happening within Node, which was helpful review.</p>
                
                <p>I was struck by how it’s important to understand what is ‘given’ and what one is ‘solving’ for. For instance, when setting up the callback for a router, it’s important to know that what is know are the objects that will be passed in.  What we are defining is the functionality itself. Given these objects, which Node will pass in for us and call the function with, what is it that you need to happen?</p>
                
                <p>This is another level up in thinking from passing in the arguments. We know the functionality, we know this will add 2 to what we pass in, but given this, what do we want to pass in? This is the most basic form of a function. This is easier to grasp I think.</p>
                
                <p>What’s a bit mroe difficult to grasp is the reverse of this. I think what makes it hard to grasp, at least for me, and today’s insight helped me with this, is that something must be defined in some way. It can’t all be abstract. </p>
                
                <p>When setting up a higher-order function, it’s all about setting up the arguments that will be passed in to the callback. This means the arguments are known - we know (and perhaps set up) the structure of the data that will be passed into the callback passed into the higher-order function.</p>
                
                <p>I hadn’t seen it quite like this before. This was helpful for me.</p>
                
                <p>Spent a bit of time reading the Express documentation. Reading docs is a good way for me to experience my growth in understanding. What used to be so heavy and dense, is much less so. I can picture more now of what the words are describing and in a way that is accurate to what is happening.</p>
                
                <p>I remember when I first was learning about Node and Express, everything was so over my head. I barely had a formed mental model yet for information to cling to . It was cool, and it took a lot of energy.</p>
                
                <p>Now that energy can be woven into a more accurate mental model and reveal new insights by that weaving. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>While talking through the code I encountered the gray area I talked about earlier. The whole text serialization and deserialization thing (terms I just read about). I encountered this when talking through the express.json() middleware. </p>
                
                <p>When sending across HTTP/HTTPS, all the information is in a serialized style. It is raw text, squished together, not very human readable. </p>
                
                <p>At either end of the request is an environment that wants to do stuff with the information, and in my case the language with which that information is interacted with is JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>This means there needs to be translation of information. This is where the JSON.stringify() (serialize) and the fetchResonse.json() (deserialize) methods come into play.</p>
                
                <p>We write the stuff we need to do in JavaScript, then when we need to make an HTTP request we have to serialize that information so it can be packaged. </p>
                
                <p>When the back-end receives a request, we know it is in the format of HTTP, we know it is serialized, so in order to work with Node, we want to deserialize that data so it can be used in JavaScript. </p>
                
                <p>So it is the serialzied form of text that certain characters come into play, such as the \n. It is in the translation that those characters gain functionality. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Unicode Characters</h3>
                <p>I decided to give myself a bit more time down this rabbit hole of characters. I think it will pay off. </p>
                
                <p>So far my my understanding has already greatly improved. It’s not great, but imporved. I ahve a better idea of where Unicode comes in and how UTF-8 translates between Unicode and binary. </p>
                
                <p>Translation. That’s what programming is at root.</p>
                
                <p>Translating between the human experience and what it takes to have a computer generate those experiences. Codifying experience. Representing this with that and vice versa. </p>
                
                <p>Human language was the first translation of experience into a technology that could recreate that experience.</p>
                
                <p>The human experience and human language is at at one end of the spectrum, the laws of physics and how reality communicates with itself is at the other end. </p>
                
                <p>Computers are the means at which we bring these two ends together. </p>

                <h3>Building: ChatGPT Project</h3>
                <p>Continuing with the ChatGPT tutorial I started awhile ago. Today is all about building.</p>
                
                <p>First portion was spent exploring what was happening with the .env file which wasn’t importing the secrets properly. Well, before this, I sent out my first request to ChatGPT to receive on the front end and it didn’t work. </p>
                
                <p>This was an opportunity to practice reading error messages. In the error message I got a 401 response from the ChatGPT server. 401 is ‘not authorized’. This told me that my API key was not working, which led me to the .env problem.</p>
                
                <p>The problem was that the .env file was at the project’s root folder (as per the instructor’s instructions), but it needed to be in the same directory as the server file that was trying to access it. After finding this out, I continued with the tutorial and sure enough the instructor encountered the same issue as me ans solved it in the same way.</p>
                
                <p>The next issue I encountered, which the instructor did not encounter is that when the reply from ChatGPT would be added to the front end, it added a new line, an extra return. </p>
                
                <p>This puzzled me so I examined the actual content of what ChatGPT was sending me back and saw that there were a number of ‘\n’ characters that were causing the issue. </p>
                
                <p>This led me to see that I have a big grey area in my understanding when it comes to how these characters work, where they work, how data is translated from JSON to JS and back again. </p>
                
                <p>In addition to this, there’s template literals and how those are parsed and displayed in HTML versus regular strings. Then there’s the ‘white-space’ property with the ‘pre-wrap’ value.</p>
                
                <p>These things I feel are fundamental when it comes to working between other APIs and one’s own.</p>
                
                <p>I spent a bit of time exploring this, thinking about how to explore it. Ultimately I threw a .trim() method onto the end of the response I was gettting from ChatGPT and that fixed the problem. However my understanding is still a bit cloudy.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Just thinking about asynchronous JS some more and how JS works when it is running code. </p>
                
                <p>There’s the initial setup of the script. This runs through, storing data and code, calling code to run, setting up code to be run when events occur.</p>
                
                <p>Setup: store data and code, run code that does things to the data, attach code to events.</p>
                
                <p>This script is attached to a webpage/website. It runs, and once run, the script is active and listening. The callstack is ready to receive and run. But if there’s no way to run another event once the script loads, then the page would just be static.</p>
                
                <p>But if there was a button on a page that was supposed to make something useful happen, then during that initial running of the script, there would be an event set up with the event handler (a callback) connected to it. </p>
                
                <p>This idea of connecting events to something that is happening at a later, but inforseeable time. This is also what async code is. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>While building yesterday’s async tool I encountered the whole commonJS versus ES modules syntax due to the fact that I have a front and a back end.</p>
                
                <p>The thing that was sinking in more is the whole concept of declaring a script file type to be a module. Which file needs this declaration?</p>
                
                <p>Many ways of declaring script file type:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On the script element in the html file.
                    </li>
                    <li>package.json object (Node related)
                    </li>
                    <li>extension <code>.mjs</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>But I am still not sure when I need to use what and where and I read multiple docs. </p>
                
                <p>Another area of confusion is the use of <code>export</code> and <code>export default</code>.</p>
                
                <p>What I need to understand this more is simply a project.</p>

                <p>This journal has become a collection of random thoughts… just me explaining stuff to myself. Each time I try to explain something to myself, I am practicing writing. In order to write means one has to order one’s thoughts. This is another thing I am learning to do, though not with intent. Sometimes you can only stack so much intention on top that every second becomes too loaded with information and burn out occurs. So for now the writing and thinking practice is a side result. </p>

                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>So far today I have spent time learning more about JS Promises. Wanting to learn more about async js and how it works because I can tell I am still fuzzy. I am getting less fuzzy on what I am fuzzy on, which is progress.</p>
                
                <p>One thing: the code that gets added to a microtask queue or macrotask queue has to run eventually, and therefore will block code from running. What are the tasks we don’t want the code to block? How does async js affect the user?</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>I used to think how async JS worked was that the code that we want to do asynchronously will run somewhere else, while the rest of the code in the document runs, then when the long running code is finished,  its result and the callback attached to the result get added to the callback queue.</p>
                
                <p>But this doesn’t seem to be what actually happens.</p>
                
                <p>If I have blocking code and I use setTimeout, the blocking code still eventually has to run in JavaScript, in the single thread. So once the current callstack is cleared that blocking code will run and it will block other things from happening when it runs. </p>
                
                <p>This is why I am confused about async. If the blockign code has to run sometime, won’t it just block the code at later time?</p>
                
                <p>Guess I just gotta build more things. </p>
                
                <h3>Building: Async JS User Interface</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this project is to help with my understanding of Async JS. I spent a lot of time studying it, but this time around I am going to build an interface for the front-end in order to clearly display impact of blocking code. </p>
                
                <p>This project has a front-end and back-end. Most asynchronous code on the web involves HTTP requests and so the back-end will serve to better mimic this.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters/The New Hard Parts</h3>
                <p>More reviewing how asynchronous JavaScript works. The crucial relationship between Web APIs, callback queue, event loop and the 3 pillars of JS: Thread of Execution, storing things in memory, callstack.</p>
                
                <p>I am getting images in my head of bubbles. Bubbles of script arising and then popping as the thread reaches its end. There is the main bubble which expands and contracts as internal bubbles expand and contract. There can only ever be one bubble within the Mother bubble (the main bubble). Within each bubble there can be infinite bably bubbles. But there is never more than one bubble within each layer. One bubble in one bubble in one bubble.</p>
                
                <p>The most inward bubble gets popped first, then it moves upward, layer by layer dissolving (or popping), ultimately aiming for the Mother layer to be empty again.</p>
                
                <p>The Mother layer is always ready to give birth to new internal layers.</p>
                
                <p>The first birthing, the intial run of any JavaScript program will set up variables, constants, functions, objects to use for all the birthing to come. </p>
                
                <p>But once the intial baby bubble arises and falls, if no other actions have been set up, that would be it. It would be pretty static. </p>
                
                <p>This is why the initial run of a script sets up how to react and behave based on user input. This means there needs to be something there to handle specific kinds of user input. This is what JavaScript and event listeners allow us to do.</p>
                
                <p>When this event happens here, run this code. That code can be something simple (dark mode, light mode) or a button that initiates a whole chain of events related to logging in.</p>
                
                <p>Another event is simply timing. After ‘x’ amount of time, run this code. That makes use of the browser’s Timer feature. Code will run after the time is up and the callstack is empty. Or if a duration isn’t specified, then the code will run once the callstack is empty.</p>
                
                <p>This idea of bubbles is interesting to me… It is making me question my current understanding of the callstack and how it relates to the macrotask and microtask lists. These would be lists of tasks to be run, in order, line by line. Each line either creates a bubble (functions), or creates and stabilizes (with identifiers) variables, constants, functions, object values, events.</p>
                
                <p>So there’s these two things. The actual birthing of bubbles, calling bubbles into existence, and  then there’s the creating and stabilizing the soap by which the bubbles come alive.  </p>
                
                <p>There’s also the phase of setting up bubble birthing opportunities. Setting up the listeners to events, to give the page its functionality, so new bubbles can come alive. </p>
                
                <p>So there’s the functions, which are blocks of saved code, waiting to be run. These are the bubbles. There’s the saved data (variables, constants, objects) and code (functions). There’s the events which will trigger certain functions to run, for certain bubbles to come alive. There’s the ordering mechanism that organizes the bubbles based on a certain kind of priority (this is the callback queue, event loop, and callstack). This is like the bathtub within which the soap resides. </p>
                
                <p>Events:</p>
                <ul><li>initial running, the set up phase.
                </li><li>user initiated events (clicks, mouse, keystrokes, scroll), page loading 
                </li><li>responses from external servers (databases, CDNs, etc.)
                </li></ul>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>User clicks a button that results in an HTTP request being made. The time this takes could be long, and if it was done synchronously, the callstack would be busy, no other actions could be taken. </p>
                
                <p>But with asynchronous capabilities, which are provided by the runtime (browser, Node), the callback, the action, attached to the event of recieving the HTTP response can be queued up to run, once the callstack is empty again. </p>
                
                <p>The response is being awaited, meanwhile the callstack is open to receive more events from the event loop and callback queue. Once the response is received the callback is added to the callback queue to be run, once the callstack is empty. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Okay, so big clarification. It seems obvious now, but I don’t think I fully got this: The event loop and the callback queue are part of the JS engine. They are fundamental aspects that make JS go.</p>
                
                <p>The Timer and Network features of the Web API and browser runtime insert callbacks into the queue based on certain events (user initiated clicks, time, network requests and responses). </p>
                
                <p>The callstack is where the magic happens. The event loop is there to ensure that only one magic happens at a time. The callback queue is there to line up the magic that wants to happen. </p>
                
                <p>Outside the callback queue, outside JS headquarters, is a wide world of opportunities for magic to be sent to the callback queue. But they need to be called in, defined, otherwise its all just a murk of potential. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>There is a sort of similarity between callstack and callback queue. They both hold blocks of code that is waiting to be run. </p>
                
                <p>Key differences are, callback queue holds individual blocks. The callstack only ever has one block running at a time. If the callstack has a number of functions, they all have generated from the bottom-most function on the callstack. </p>
                
                <p>The bottom function of the callstack is the main block of code that called other blocks of code. The bottom function was called by the callstack. The callstack can only call one function at a time. One block of code. </p>
                
                <p>The only entrance to the callstack is the event loop. Event loop is the snarling secratary. The callback queue has lots of entrances. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters/Node and Servers: The Hard Parts</h3>
                <p>Attempting to implement a new practice here. Each session, the first portion of it is reviewing what has come before. How each video built on the last. Creating a main points map somewhere.</p>
                
                <p>Looking back on the course. Understanding what Node is, what it does, what its purpose is. </p>
                
                <p>Node is an asynchronous event drive JavaScript runtime.</p>
                
                <p>Node is there to create servers that can handle a lot of traffic, in a way that is non-blocking (asynchronous).</p>
                
                <p>Node operates within a specific portion of the server. There’s the hardware and network port, there’s the language used to communicate with the computer’s parts, there’s Node which translates the C++ into and out of JavaScript. Node also utilizes libuv, which I am a bit more fuzzy on as far as what it does, or where exactly it participates… so off to research.</p>
                
                <p>Okay! Libuv is the part of the Node runtime that provides the asynchronous, event-driven I/O capabilities and features like timers, asynchronous file system access, etc. </p>
                
                <p>Libuv serves as the event loop mechanism. Node serves as a way to maneuver between the asynchronous event loop provided by libuv and the single-threadedness of JavaScript. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Thing that is hitting me for whatever reason: the internet is essentially a computer that is never off. More accurately, millions and millions of computers that are always on. That’s the point of the internet, to be available always. </p>
                
                <p>What Node allows for is efficient response to large numbers of requests.</p>
                
                <p>A computer, always on, being tapped all at once by millions of people, and that computer responding to each of the taps, grabbing the files necessary, making API calls, retreiving and conditioning response data, packaging the response and sending it back. Millions of times per second. Always on.</p>
                
                <p>Node allows us to build things like this. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>This intersting translation pattern of client-server relations and Node.</p>
                
                <p>HTTP>received by Network card>C++ interacts with Network card>Node interacts with C++>JavaScript interacts with Node, then back through again. </p>
                
                <p>I used to overcomplicate this. I see much more clearly now what Node is for. Creating servers. Servers are all about the Network transmission. It makes sense then that, given that all HTTP requests have responses sent back, the entirety of Node is built around the Request and Response objects. </p>
                
                <p>Two things and what goes on in the space between. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>I am falling into the trap of tutorial hell. I am learning (slowly), that there is a definite line between learning concepts and applying concepts. The application of concepts is arguably the most important bit (depending on one’s goals).</p>
                
                <p>I am loving growing my base understanding of JS. It is a cool technology and I believe it will help me to shift my career aims positively. With that said, learning itself is displayed via the application of it.</p>
                
                <p>Right now I need to prove that I can do things. This ‘proof’ comes in the form of projects. </p>
                
                <p>This means that there is a trick in balancing that needs to occur here. Building and learning. I am not doing very well in balancing this. </p>
                
                <p>Other areas I am definitely weak at: Algorithms and Data Structures</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters/The New Hard Parts</h3>
                <p>Going over async JS again today. </p>
                
                <p>Async JS is a capability provided not by JS itself, but the runtime environment. </p>
                
                <p>The common runtime environment is the Browser. Browsers run on computers. Browsers can interact with computers in ways JS cannot. Computers are not single-threaded. JS is single-threaded.</p>
                
                <p>Through ‘facade’ functions, which are labels in JS, we can interact with Web APIs, which give us capabilities beyond JS. </p>
                
                <p>The two biggest features that Browsers and the other runtime, Node, give us are Timers and Network features. Both of these allow us to essentially bump long-running, blocking code in the background and give us the opportunity to invite code back into the Thread of Execution at a later time, assigning tasks/callbacks to run upon completion of the blocking code. </p>
                
                <p>In order for this to work, there are two other runtime features: callback queue and event loop.</p>
                
                <p>The callback queue is where callbacks related to Timer and Network features are added. These callbacks get queued and are added to the callstack (callstack is JS) via the event loop. In a way the event loop is what connects the non-JS task results back into the JS world.</p>
                
                <p>The event loop monitors that callstack and once the callstack is empty, the first callback in the callback queue is added to the callstack. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Breaking down what setTimeout does a bit further. When setTimeout is encountered by JS, the Timer feature of the runtime is invoked, a callback and an optional duration are passed as arguments. After the TImer is invoked, JS moves onto the next line. </p>
                
                <p>If there is a duration for the Timer, that duration sets the time at which the callback is added to the queue. </p>
                
                <p>In a sense, setTimeout is saying “run this specific block of code, but do so at a later time; don’t block the rest of the code in the current Thread of Execution from running.” In another sense, it bumps the code to the end of the line. This allows other important code to run to its conclusion before the blocking code is executed. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Definitely the area where I am still confused/fuzzy on, is what tasks get run in what context? Another problem is simply wording this cofusion I have more accurately.</p>
                
                <p>I know that blocking code will prevent other actions from happening. At root, this is simply the next line of code. </p>
                
                <p>Code is triggered to run by events. The loading of a webpage will run any linked script. When that script is encountered, its code will run from top to bottom. Once it hits “bottom” or the end of the script, then it will be ready and waiting to run any additional code that gets added.</p>
                
                <p>But how does code get added?</p>
                
                <p>The original code was added when the script itself was authored. But this code is relatively static, in that when a webapge loads, there isn’t necessarily someone there on the other side waiting to add new lines of code. But if there was, and code was added, then what would occur is the entire script would run again, from top to bottom. </p>
                
                <p>Additional code is also “added” by way of events and actions tied to those events.</p>
                
                <p>These events are specified and the actions are tied to the events during the initial loading of the script. </p>
                
                <p>If there is a listener for clicks, each time the user clicks on the EventTarget, the assigned callback is executed. </p>
                
                <p>Where does this execution occur? It occurs via the callstack. The callback is added to the callstack and the callstack executes code in a first in, last out manner (or last in, first out… same thing). </p>
                
                <p>So let’s say the page loads, the initial code runs, listeners are set up and actions are attached to events. After loading, the callstack is empty and waiting to pounce on any new calls that get added to it. </p>
                
                <p>A user clicks the button, a new call is added to the stack. This call has some blocking code. While this code runs, the user clicks other buttons, but is getting no immediate response. What is occurring is that each button click while the blocking code is running is being added to the callstack. Once the blocking code finishes, the callstack moves onto the next function call.</p>
                
                <p>Where are these other button clicks being added? Is it the callback queue? I am not sure.</p>
                
                <p>I know that when a function is called, that function call is added to the callstack. In order to stack other calls on top of that original call, then within the execution context of that function there would need to be calls to other functions. Each call would be added on top of the original call. The only way to create a stack of calls is to have function calls within function calls. </p>
                
                <p>In this sense, the callstack only really takes in one function call at a time. It looks like multiple function calls are being added on top, but all that layering is due to a single function call upon which all the others depend. </p>
                
                <p>Once that original function call reaches the end of its execution context, then JS will move on to the next line of code within the document. If there is one. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Okay, so after doing a bit of reading, I see now that when an event listener is connected to a callback, when the event occurs, the callback is added to the callback queue. This makes sense to me now. </p>
                
                <p>Callback queue depends on an empty callstack. The event loop is the listener for the empty callback and its task is to pass in the next callback in the callback queue to the callstack. </p>
                
                <p>So if a user clicks a button and the callstack is empty at the time of the clicking, the callback connected to the click event on that event target will be added to the callback queue, the event loop will pass this to the callstack and that function’s execution context will be woven into JS’ Thread of Execution.</p>
                
                <p>If the code within this execution is blocking code, then when other clicks occur, the callback (action) tied to those clicks will be added to the callback queue and will not run until the callstack is once again empty. This delay creates poor user experience. </p>
                
                <p>The purpose of Async JS is to eliminate this. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Now I am a bit less fuzzy, but I still need some truly concrete examples of the type of stuff that is blocking and the best way to move it out of the way, so to speak. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters/Node and Servers: The Hard Parts</h3>
                <p>Reviewing more of what Node is at its basic level.</p>
                
                <p>I spent a lot of time jsut writing about it in ways I did yesterday. I remember encountering this stuff a year ago with a different course. One of the coolest courses I’ve done (ZTM Node course). </p>
                
                <p>Having that first encounter is important. The potency of that encounter becomes more evident the next time it is encountered. I have a better internal mental map now of how JS works and how the internet works in general. This makes it easier to learn the detailed stuff.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>One thing that Will has gone into detail about is wht http.createServer() is doing behind the scenes. </p>
                
                <p>http.createServer() is not JS. It looks like JS, but it is evoking Node. Specifically it is a Node command to open up a port on the network card of the computer. Node is the translation layer between JS and C++. C++ is used to communicate with the computer of the server, giving JS capabilities it doesn’t have on its own, such as accessing the network card of a computer. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Node.js is an event-driven asynchronous JS runtime. The event-driven means that there are specific kinds of server related events that occur on the computer and we can code in how to respond to those specific events. We can make up our own events. </p>
                
                <p>The network card on servers is an event that Node allows us to tie into using JavaScript. </p>
                
                <p>Event driven means there will be callbacks. Node is the one putting the parenthesis on the function identifier. Not us. We specifiy what we want to have happen. We specifiy on what kinds of inputs certain things should happen. Node is set up to listen and do. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>The two most important data that Node works with are HTTP requests. It is set up to handle these. A request arrives at the Network card. The long HTTP request string is then parsed by Node and converted into a JS object.  As soon as Node creates the incoming request object, it creates the outgoing request object.</p>
                
                <p>Both of these objects will serve as the arguments to whatever callback we pass into http.createServer(doStuff).</p>
                
                <p>These callbacks are special callbacks, dealing with specific types of informtion: HTTP requests. The request and the response. We are given the liberty of naming the parameters whatever we want, but req and res are used quite often. </p>
                
                <p>Within the body of the callback, stuff is happening. Data is being taken from the request object. Data is being packaged for a response object.</p>
                
                <p>One key method that exists on the response object is .end(). This is what tells Node to finish packaging up the HTTP response and send it back to the client. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters/The New Hard Parts</h3>
                <p>I decided to start another of Will Sentance’s courses. A lot of this is going to be review from the last one, but I think it will be helpful.</p>
                
                <p>I am going to do my best to not take forever on this course. </p>
                
                <p>What I like about Will and his style is his precision iwth communication. This creates better, more accurate mental models.</p>
                
                <p>Understanding where something is being stored (global, local), understanding its execution context, and understanding the call stack, event loop and callback queue (and Web APIs). These are foundational to all JS programming.</p>
                
                <p>It’s the same guy, but a new course and thus a new perspective on these fundamentals. Plus I trust this guy. He seems to know his stuff. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>One of the 3 pillars of JS is the ability to store data and code into memory. Memory comes in many forms. The foundational form is global memory. These are accessible from anywhere within the program. They are globally available. It is important to keep this area clean.</p>
                
                <p>The next layer is local memory. These come and go with local execution contexts. They are created whenever a function runs. As soon as the new execution context created by running/calling a function comes to the end, the locally stored variables get deleted. That memory is freed up.</p>
                
                <p>However, there is another sort of in between storage. This is the Persistant Lexical Scope Reference Data, or a closure. Whenever a function is returned by another function, the relevant variables and states are stored with the returned function in a sort of backpack. It is a hidden property called <code>[[scope]]</code>. </p>
                
                <p>This in-between storage is useful in ways that I can get a glimpse of, but have yet to see practical application of. But I know about them. </p>
                
                <p>One way I see it to be useful is for not polluting the global namespace. This is good for memory, it is good for naming. It creates a bit of security for the function’s and the global stored data and all code depending on them. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>What is an ‘execution context’? Every execution context is made up of two components: the thread of execution (code to be run in the main Thread of Execution) and the memory. There’s the global execution context within which the code runs. Within the global execution context, local execution contexts are created and destroyed as functions get called. Each local execution context has a thread of execution and a local storage. These get woven in and then out of the main Thread of Execution. </p>
                
                <p>JS is single-threaded, synchronous. Line by line. This is powerful in its own way. With it also comes challenges when it comes to blocking code. Enter Asynchronous.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Asynchronicity. All about transferring long running code to the end of the line, so to speak. </p>
                
                <p>To have code that takes a long time run in a way that lets other UI and UX features through (mouse movement, button clicking, etc.) periodically. </p>
                
                <p>To have work be done outside of JS, but within its runtime, using the features of the browser, to do tasks in the background, while other code is allowed to run, then when the task is finished, a callback is added to the callback queue, and added to the call stack by the event loop once the call stack and microtasks are finished running. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters/Node and Servers: The Hard Parts</h3>
                <p>Started this course as well. I am super excited for this one. I don’t know why Node.js excites me. It just seems like a lot of potential lies here. This is also why I am learning JS. I feel it makes a good concurrent study along with the JS courses.</p>
                
                <p>Reviewing the process of moving data and files between client and server side. The HTTP request. The anatomy of the URL, which is the means of communication. </p>
                
                <p>Once you enter a website URL into the browser URL bar and hit enter we no longer need to interface with the URL bar’s address. All other HTTP requests are happening ‘behind the scenes’. These are connected to navigation between pages, authenticating, authorizing, and interfacing with databases. </p>
                
                <p>Data is important and so it is protected by a layer. This layer is the ‘back-end’. This is the code that runs on the server side. It is, in its most secure form, inaccessible without authentication and authorization. </p>
                
                <p>Front end sends an HTTP request to a URL. Back-end receives the request and none of the code that is running here is accessible to the client that made the request. Based on the specific value of the file path, the backend has a response. The response is either a failure, or is a success. A successful response results in Logically determined files being sent out to the client.</p>
                
                <p>Front-end browser receives the files and does its thing with them. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>JavaScript on its own saves data and code and executes code. Node is like the browser in that it grants JS access to functionalities it doesn’t have, but looks like JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>Node.js is the bridge between JS and C++.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters</h3>
                <p>It is the day to finish Will’s course. </p>
                
                <p>More reviewing and going over OOP and specifically what the ‘new’ keyword does. </p>
                
                <p>I find that the details get a bit tiresome if one loses sight of what the details are for and what they do.</p>
                
                <p>When creating multiple instances of objects that have some shared pattern, it makes sense that certain shared patterns be shared amongst all the instances. This is good for memory in general. This is also great for updating and adding features to the objects.</p>
                
                <p>This object of shared behaviors (and sometimes properties) is the prototype that all instances would be built from.</p>
                
                <p>Before the ‘new’ keyword was introduced in ES6 it was a common practice to create some object that would serve as the prototype of all the instances created from it. Then, within the constructor function, a new object would be created using <code>Object.create(identifierOfPrototype)</code>, then poperties would be assigned, and that new object, with its connection to the prototype object, would be returned.</p>
                
                <p>Each calling of this function created a new version of the object, but each version was connected to a single source of truth for the shared behaviors.</p>
                
                <p>The ‘new’ keyword came along with ES6 and replaced some of the tasks we had to manually do before. By using the ‘new’ keyword an object is created, connected to ‘this’ and returned. The <code>.__proto__</code> property of the new object is assigned to the constructor function’s object’s .property object value. </p>
                
                <p>This prototype object is accessed and updated by the .prototype property of the object connected to the constructor function itself. It is automatically there and connected to each new instance of an object created using the ‘new’ keyword.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Another way of putting it. When the constructor function is called, the new keyword causes action within</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>This pattern of replacing steps that are being done over and over is the DRY principle in practice. But again, in order to become more DRY compliant, we had to go through the desert of repetition to build up a standard that could then be functionalized. In order to not repeat ourselves we had to first repeat ourselves to see what wass repeated. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>I think the biggest take away for today (so far) has been diving more deeply into how functions are special objects. Will went over how whenever a function is defined, there is also an object connected to the function value. It’s not talked about much, but it is there. </p>
                
                <p>This object has a ‘prototype’ property. The value assigned to this is an object (empty by default). </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>I have a better understanding of what ‘class’ does now. Will has done a good job at walking me up through the old ways that established the ‘shortcuts’ (‘new’ and ‘class’) that do all those things for us. </p>
                
                <p>I can now say what ‘new’ does. ‘ It does three things: creates a new object, assigns properties and methods to it, assigns the <code>.__proto__</code>property of the new object the object assigned to the ‘prototype’ property of the object that is connected to constructor function, then returns that object.</p>
                
                <p>Once the constructor function is defined/declared, then in a separate step the ‘prototype’ object is filled in with methods and properties to be the single source of truth for all instances created from it. </p>
                
                <p>What ‘class’ does is allows us to package both of those things (creating the constructor function and then add methods to the prototype) together, which is similar to how it’s done in many other languages that use OOP.</p>

                <p>While walking today, I realized a way I can implement the fake processing time without using the setTimeout. I realized that the fake processing time is time that would be taken on the server end, so that’s where I should implement the code blocker function. </p>
                
                <p>To make it more fun and to practice creating an API, I decided to make a specialized route for this. The path is ‘/wait/:time’. This takes advantage of Express’ parameter feature. On the front end, I created a random time generator in milliseconds, the value of which is returned to the time parameter of the path of the GET request..</p>

                <h3>Building: ChatGPT Project #1</h3>
                <p>Continuing with the simple server project I made a couple days ago. It is looking much nicer since yesterday’s work on it. </p>
                
                <p>It’s a simple project. The front end consists of  2 parts: a text input and submit button within a form, which when submitted, the text input is displayed in the message container window below it. The second part consists of a button that sends a GET request to the back end and adds the response data to the message container below.</p>
                
                <p>There is a very simple database of random phrases/responses. This database has no persistent qualities to it.</p>
                
                <p>The more I think about this project the more opportunities I see for different sections that would demonstrate server functionalities. I am thinking the basics of RESTful, so CRUD operations. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>So far today I built out a first draft of the response feature. The user types in a greeting, the greeting is sent to the back end in a POST request. The greeting is then passed along to ChatGPT (not in this app, but let’s pretend here). While we wait for the response we see a little dot animation.</p>
                
                <p>Right now I feel like the functions that run this are a bit of a mess and kind of tangled. A lot of this tangling is just me wanting to implement a ‘thinking’  feature: the dots running for 3 seconds or so and then adding in a response.</p>
                
                <p>How it works as of now is there is a ‘loadingDots’ function. I initially intended for this to be a simple function. One that takes in an element as an argument, then runs a simple dot animation, building up to 4 dots, then resetting to one, over and over.</p>
                
                <p>For this basic functionality I am using setInterval. Each interval runs the callback which concatenates a new ‘.’ onto the end and checks if four dots are present, if so, it resets it back to 1 ‘.’</p>
                
                <p>The problem is that I want these dots to play on the screen for a certain amount of time, which means I need to tie the running of the response to the end of the ‘timer’. </p>
                
                <p>To do this I added a time checking function into the loadingDots function and then once the time went passed say 5 secs, then it would do the rest of the stuff. </p>
                
                <p>But this made the loadingDots functions way more complicated.</p>
                
                <p>To fix this, I moved the getting response and adding the response to a new container and typing the text out into a new function. I then used setTimeout to mimic some async code running in the background.</p>
                
                <p>At first I tried using a code blocking function, but this halted everything, no dot animation or anything, then everything came in all at once. The reason is because the dot jobs were being added to the queue while the blocking code was running, then once the blocking code finished, all the jobs went all at once, which destroyed the effect. </p>
                
                <p>But setTimeout to the rescue.</p>

                <h4>Why Coding</h4>
                
                <p>Spent some time today thinking about why I am learning to code. What got me started was certainly the job prospect. What kept me learning is still the job prospect for sure, but there’s something else too. There’s an interest. I don’t know where the interest comes from. I simply think coding is cool.</p>
                
                <p>Okay. But why? I like the problem solving aspects. When I first started learning it had been sometime since I exercised those kinds of thinking muscles. I forgot how good it felt to do so. So that kept me going for a bit.</p>
                
                <p>Taking a project out of the abyss of abstraction and putting something together that does something cool and potentially useful gives me a nice, wholesome feeling. It exercises the creative muscle as well. </p>
                
                <p>But there’s other things. Things that feel deeply philosophical, and also deeply intimate, in some way, with the Nature of Reality itself. But I am still unclear.</p>
                
                <p>So I asked myself, what is it that devices allow us to do? What are computers? What can they be used for? They allow us to create data (music, writing, movies, art, educational material) in a way that can be shared easily. They give us access to the others who would want to consume our data. They help us to find other data to consume. Find others whose data output we can appreciate. Interact with others remotely, synchronously and asynchronously (building a global collective self-awareness). At the root is data, information. Processing information in creative ways. Using these devices which are extraordinarily capable, to take in, process, and send out information packets. </p>
                
                <p>What for? </p>
                
                <p>Consumption. This can be distraction, entertainment, education. </p>
                
                <p>Connection (or lack thereof). Email, messaging, social networks, conferencing.</p>
                
                <p>Production. Creating, educating, processing (in some form or another), sharing. </p>
                
                <p>Information and its processing is not new. This is how humans evolved. The ability to capture information into more stable forms to outlast the flow of time. To quicken the learning of the next generation. Information has been a sword with two edges ever since it came to be.</p>
                
                <p>So what do I want to use it for? </p>
                
                <p>I want to do good. What is good? See how it gets deep and philosophical?</p>
                
                <p>Learning to code is ultimately about learning to utilize the capabilities of these highly programmable machines that have GPS, wifi, cameras and microphones, etc. But it is also about finding where my own creativity meets these capabilities. The creativity is there. But it also blossoms in new ways when my own capacity to interface with these machines grows. </p>
                
                <p>Having a bigger picture of what computers are, what they do, stepping back into broader strokes of abstraction, helps me to feel more connected to the pursuit for the sake of the journey, not the catch. Chasing the catch for the sake of the catch is not a good use of time. Chasing the catch for the sake of the chase itself is more profound. And, it is never too late to change styles. Good thing and bad thing.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters</h3>
                <p>Continuing with the section in Will’s course on Classes and OOP.</p>
                
                <p>Today he discussed this interesting ‘feature’ with arrow functions and how they alter the object referenced by ‘this’.</p>
                
                <p>Here, using declaration (same behavior with function expression as well), ‘this’ will refer to the object on which it is called, so obj1.</p>
                <pre><code>const obj1 = {
                    someMethod() {
                        console.log(this); //'this' refers to obj1
                    }
                }</code></pre>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Here, using arrow expression, when obj.someMethod() is called it will log the Window object. Here the function</p>
                <pre><code>const obj2 = {
                    someMethod: () =&gt; {
                        console.log(this); //'this' refers to Window
                    }
                }
                </code></pre>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Started going over the ‘new’ keyword and all the things that happen behind the scenes that we don’t have to do anymore.</p>
                
                <p>Will went through a useful progression here, which is helping me see and appreciate the ‘new’ keyword.</p>
                
                <p>The method used prior to this was to store an object of stored functions. This object would be set as the prototype of objects created by the object factory function.</p>
                
                <p>Within the object factory, properties and methods were created and assigned to the newly created object and was returned.</p>
                
                <p>This is not a bad way of doing it. There is a good sense of obvious control over the functions within the prototype, making it easy to update.</p>
                
                <p>The ‘new’ keyword does this for us. The question I have is, if I am not creating this prototype object with the functions/methods, then how do I access it? How do I store stuff within it?</p>
                
                <p>To be continued…</p>

                <p>I spent time today building out a better looking front end. Learned how to add some styling to the scrollbar as well. I wouldn’t have bothered with doing so, except the default scroll bar was breaking out of the rounded borders of the container. </p>
                
                <p>I built out this front end because I want to share the basic server project I created the other day with you, but it was looking super plain.</p>

                <p>Yesterday I spent all my coding time on the ChatGPT project. It involved starting to build out the back end. There was a lot of review going on as well. It’s been several months since I spun up a server. Building projects with both front and back ends is what really makes me excited about coding. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters</h3>
                <p>Spending an hour today continuing with Will Sentance’s JavaScript The Hard Parts v2 course. I am on the last section on OOP and classes. </p>
                
                <p>Quick review of last time:</p>
                <p>All code should do 3 things: Easy to reason out, easy to add new features to, and efficient and performant.</p>
                
                <p>OOP paradigm helps with all three of the features above. By using objects we can group our functions along with the data that those functions do work on. This makes it easy to read what is happening.</p>
                
                <p>Prototypal inheritance is excellent for adding new features in an efficient manner. The prototype is a special object, a lower level object, that serves as a collective reference for the many objects that are based on that prototype. </p>
                
                <p>One of the places I can see this layering of object types is in the DOM. Each  element is built on top of an Element class that has a number of methods and properties. Each specific element has specific features and properties that are layered on top of the Element class. </p>
                
                <p>One way to assign an object a prototype is by using Object.create(prototypeObjectName). </p>
                
                <p>End of review</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>There are 2 main things that coding requires: code to run and memory to store stuff.</p>
                
                <p>What prototypes and inheritance helps us to achieve is efficiency. This efficiency comes in the form of a single source of truth for certain properties and methods, which makes adding features less complicated. </p>
                
                <p>Efficiency also comes in the form of storage. By having the single source of truth (i.e. prototypal inheritance) we don’t have to make multiple copies of the same data. </p>
                
                <p>Both of these efficiencies become more important an application grows in complexity.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>I am curious how the ‘this’ keyword is working within objects set as prototypes. Let’s say a prototypal object has a property of ‘score’ and a method of ‘this.score++’.</p>
                
                <p>What’s interesting to me is that if a new object is created and assigned the previous object as its prototype, but doesn’t have a ‘score’ property, the method that increments the score will depend upon the score property within the prototype. But if the new object does have a score property, then that score property will be incremented by the method on the prototype.</p>
                
                <p>The ‘this’ keyword seems work in the same fashion as the prototypal chain functionality. If an object method is called, the object itself will be checked for the method, if it is not present it will move down the chain. When it encounters the method, if the ‘this’ keyword is present, ‘this’ will refer first to the top of chain and its referenced object will move down the chain as well. </p>
                
                <p>‘This’ is an implicit parameter. It is implied. </p>
                
                <p>‘This’ is all about context. It starts on its outermost container on which a ‘this’ is evoked and goes down from there. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Will is going over the difference is terms of the <code>__proto__</code> property, which is a link to the next object down the chain, and the term ‘prototype’. He hasn’t gotten there just yet. </p>
                
                <p>I think the difference has to do with action. A prototype is a lower foundational level of an object. The <code>__proto__</code> property is an action (deprecated) that will return the object sitting at the next level down the chain.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Will went over the interesting thing that happens with ‘this’ when a function is defined and called within a method. This brought me back around to the .call() method and how that works. There’s a lot of the wrapping back around action happening as of late. This is a very good thing. It means that it’s not all new territory anymore and so reinforcement occurs more regularly and more subtler details emerge.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: ChatGPT Project #1</h3>
                <p>I am going to spend some time rebuilding the little server project. I can tell that there are lots of gaps in my understanding.</p>
                
                <p>I am starting to get a better idea of how the front and back end interact. The means to the interactions are HTTP requests. The front end needs to some stuff from the back end and so sends out a request. No matter what kind of request is sent (GET, POST being the two most common), there is always a response from the back-end with some form of status for the transaction, some way to tell whether the transaction succeeded or failed.</p>
                
                <p>This is not in-built necessarily. If we humans had to code our existence, we would learn that an important aspect of surviving is being able to tell if something is worth doing. We would learn to code for blood and pain. These would be the responses we get back with precious information.</p>
                
                <p>For me, the GET request is obviously going to get a response back. That is the whole purpose of the GET request. The POST request is less obvious simply because it is sending information to the server. But like Certified Mail, it is nice to have some sort of signifier that things went well over in back-end land. This is the purpose of the response for a POST request. It is necessary. </p>
                
                <p>The means to communicate between front and backends are addresses. There’s the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS), there’s the domain name (in my case most of the time this is localhost:PORT), then there’s the path itself. </p>
                
                <p>These can be anything we want them to be. For them to work though there needs to be something to receive a request to a specific address. </p>
                
                <p>That’s where the back-end comes in. This is essentially what APIs are. They provided a specific address where a specific task can be completed. The back-end tasks assigned to the address are essentially tied to an event. That event is the front-end calling to the back-end (or even one back-end calling to another). If a call is made to a specific domain name with a relevant path, that event is handled accordingly.</p>
                
                <p>There’s a couple things to help differentiate what to do. There’s the request method (GET, POST, etc), and there’s the address, but most importantly, as far as setting up specific actions, is the path.</p>
                
                <p>Paths generally point to collections or items. </p>
                
                <p>When a call is made, there is some processing of data that usually needs to occur. This occurs on the back and front ends. There is a standard of how front-ends and back-ends should communicate. This standard is REST. </p>
                
                <p>The general format data takes is JSON. This provides a certain level of predictability in regards to data processing on either end (front or back).</p>
                
                <p>The front-end is all about human interaction. Clicking buttons, seeing things, highlighting, copying and pasting, entering in information. </p>
                
                <p>The back-end is all about doing the stuff that needs to be hidden from the front-end. Without this hidden layer, then there would be no means of securing the internet. Everything on the front-end is accessible and viewable. The back-end is not. </p>
                
                <p>I know that certain paths can be revealed by inspecting the code on the front end, but ultimately what goes on in the back-end is, well, more secure. </p>
                
                <p>The other aspect of the back-end is communicating with databases. The internet itself is based on data. Data is everything. Everything is in bits and bytes, ultimately strings, numbers, boolean. At my current low experience level I would say these are the 3 main forms of data. With the data, coding can be done. </p>
                
                <p>So databases are where the information is stored, read, updated, and deleted. Why can’t a front-end just access a database without using the back-end? This is a good question.</p>
                
                <p>I am able to venture an answer. If the internet is all about data, then that data needs to be secured and protected. If something were to happen to the data itself, then all the value that that data provided becomes lost.</p>
                
                <p>The back-end connects to the database behind the public scenes. It is where credentials are exchanged out of sight (if done properly). This means that the ones who have access to the database and how interactions with the database take place are those who need to know. The public not only doesn’t need to know, but if they did know, would most likely make a mess of things. </p>
                
                <p>Matter of fact I bet that in the early stages of the Internet, the public did have some sort of access to this information and it led to messes, that resulted in the solutions we see today.</p>

                <h3>Building: ChatGPT Project #1</h3>
                <p>Yesterday, I finished getting the front end logic set up. There are some things happening in this tutorial that I am not sure about and/or have questions about. </p>
                
                <p>One thing I am not sure about is the use of .innerHTML to generate the message containers. I have read about some of the disadvantages of using .innerHTML, yet how else could this be done?</p>
                
                <p>I found this nifty article, <a href="https://gomakethings.com/a-safer-alternative-to-innerhtml-with-vanilla-js/" target="_blank">A safer alternative to innerHTML with vanilla JS</a>.</p>
                
                <p>One of the major reasons to be wary of .innerHTML are the security risks namely in the form of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs when malicious scripts are injected into a website. When we use .innerHTML and give a third-party access to our site’s DOM, that access can be taken advantage of. </p>
                
                <p>I found it useful to know that .innerHTML is okay when injecting our own markup into the DOM. I would still like to know a bit more how the XSS works. </p>
                
                <p>The article also goes over a way to sanitize 3rd-party markup before it gets added to the DOM. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>How some classes are generated bugs me. There’s a class that uses an and statement short-circuit. The problem is that if the first data is false, then a false class is added to the rendered element. I don’t like a useless class. But I will let it slide for now.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>I learned about form events. I did not know an event handler listening for ‘submit’ could be added to the form element. </p>
                
                <p>This gave me a flash of insight into HTML elements and the DOM, and how each specific element has their own custom features built into them. How each specific HTML element is built on top of a more generalized class called Element, and so on and so forth. </p>
                
                <p>This connects back around to what I have been learning recently in Will’s course. Everything is essentially an object (even when the language is a functional programming language. The way to package up inheritable qualities (properties) and behaviors (methods) is to use objects. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Exploring the FormData object. Exploring MDN to see what I can do with these kinds of objects. </p>
                
                <p>Apparently the data from the inputs is packaged up in a key/value pair based on the ‘name’ attribute of the input element and its input, which is text in this case. </p>
                
                <p>To access, or get to this data, we use the .get() method that comes with FormData objects. The argument is the value of the ‘name’ attribute of the HTML element.</p>
                
                <p>I am thinking I need to just build like 100 forms with a functioning front and back end, so I can be more familiar with building these crucial components. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Yesterday I got started on the backend. This is where the tutorial starts venturing into ChatGPT land. </p>
                
                <p>OpenAi’s website is quite helpful and nicely put together. I am still struggling a bit with understanding how to query ChatGPT appropriately, but this is because I haven’t explored it much yet. That’s the biggest point of doing this tutorial.</p>
                
                <p>It’s been awhile since I was in back-end land and so its nice to be back. This is where there’s just a whole new layer of thinking in regards to design and data and all that. I am looking forward to what new ways I will be encountering this.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Spent time creating a simple server to test out an issue I was having that I couldn’t pinpoint. The issue: forgot the ’s’ in ‘headers’. </p>
                
                <p>Even though the problem was due to something small, the effort was still good. Just spinning up a mini front and back end served as real good practice. When I start working with the back end I get the sense that this is truly where the excitement lie. This is where APIs are interacted with, this is the brains of the front-facing site. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters</h3>
                <p>Starting on the objects section of Will’s Sentence’s course. This will be review, but Will’s perspective and ways of explaining things give me a new perspective and thus my understanding is broadened.</p>
                
                <p>Will described OOP as a means of keeping one’s code organized. Specifically he mentions 3 goals all code, no matter the language, should aim for: 1) to be readable, understandable, easy to reason out; 2) easy to add new features; 3) efficient and performant.</p>
                
                <p>He describes OOP as a means to accomplish this. </p>
                
                <p>He shed a new perspective on objects and methods: using the dot notation allows us to answer multiple questions: What are we accomplishing (what function is being called? What changes are being made?)? To what data is this being applied to? </p>
                
                <p>This perspective of all applications being data and actions taken using that data, whether to read, create, update, delete (the 4 main data related actions) adds a new layer of understanding of what programming is essentially doing at root and why OOP is such a useful paradigm. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Another concept that is becoming more clear is the importance of inheritance and prototypes. When individual instances of objects are created, they will all share properties and methods, based on the constructor. Some properties will have unique values to the instance itself. There will be properties and methods that we want the instances collectively share, to have a single source of truth of. This is especially true for updating features. </p>
                
                <p>If I come out with a new feature which is essentially adding a new method to an object, say a User object for example.  But what if I have many users that are already created? Without a single-source of truth for each user instance to reference, in order to add the feature, each individual object will have to be updated, and this is a pain.</p>
                
                <p>This is wrapping around to the mental model that Just JavaScript implanted into me and is reinforcing it and vice versa. </p>
                
                <h3>Building: ChatGPT Project #1</h3>
                <p>Spent a bit of time going over yesterday’s code and where I left off. I left off at trying to understand this scrolling functionality implemented in this project.</p>
                
                <p>New messages get added to the chatContainer section. Doing this will eventually cause the chatContainer’s height to expand. New messages are at the bottom and when new messages are added, they are scrolled into view. </p>
                
                <p>To do this the .scrollTop property of the chatContainer is set to be equal to the .scrollHeight property. What confuses me is that this doesn’t necessarily set the .scrollTop to be the exact value of .scrollHeight, but rather scroll the specific container down as much as it can. </p>
                
                <p>I think this is what the point of setting .scrollTop to be equal to the value of .scrollHeight. When new messages are added we can’t know the height of the element added - this will be a constantly varying thing. To account for this we just give .scrollTop a value that will ensure it always scrolls to the bottom. Explaining this right here just helped me a lot. </p>

                <p>I spent a bit too much time yesterday on the project exploring setTimeout. I think some interesting things were happening that could be worthwhile to explore further. </p>

                <p>The first interesting thing is this: I had a for loop and just incremented a variable up to 1e9. I connected the function triggering this for loop to a button. When I click the button the first time after page reloading (in Chrome), it shows the process took 1.5 secs roughly. Every time after that it would take almost twice as long. Not sure why. </p>
                
                <p>Also, in Firefox, the same function would take a bit longer, but would take the same amount of time each time I clicked, so it was more consistent.</p>
                
                <p>The other interesting thing had to do with user interactivity. When I had buttons connected to the process functions, it would prevent me from getting the user feedback when hovering or clicking other buttons, though the clicks themselves would get registered and queued up. One of the functions took almost twice as long as expected and I am not sure why.</p>
                
                <p>All of this makes me want to create some sort of playground project that helps people (and me!) understand the practical application of async javascript. One that replicates slowness on a site and then shows how to make that same slow process occur in a way that is not interrupting to the UX.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters</h3>
                <p>Picking up on Will Sentance’s JavaScript The Hard Parts v2. Finishing the Promises section. </p>
                
                <p>One thing that is bugging me is that the example he is using seems to be inaccurate. Using fetch() returns a Promise, but it seems that the promise itself ends up getting wrapped into a new macrotask list. I can see this is the case because of a simple example:</p>
                
                <pre><code>console.log('Start of Macrotask List 1');
                
                setTimeout(() =&gt; {
                    console.log("Start of Macrotask List 2")
                });
                
                setTimeout(() =&gt; {
                    console.log("Start of Macrotask List 5... Note the duration parameter is set.")
                }, 1);
                
                Promise.resolve()
                    .then(() =&gt; console.log("Start of Microtask List 1"))
                    .then(() =&gt; setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log("Start of Macrotask List 4")))
                
                const fetchedData = fetch('https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random');
                
                fetchedData
                    .then(() =&gt; console.log("I would expect this to be in Microtask 1, but it is actually the last thing to print. This tells me that the microtask from the promise is wrapped into a new macrotask list."))
                
                Promise.resolve()
                    .then(() =&gt; console.log("End of Microtask list 1"))
                
                console.log('End of Macrotask List 1');</code></pre>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>So using fetch creates a new Macrotask list. What’s interesting to me is how the behavior of the setTimeout changes when I add just 1ms to the duration of the timeout. </p>
                
                <p>1ms is a long time from a computer’s perspective. A lot of action can happen during that 1ms. In this case it seems that the response from the API in the code above occurs within 1ms. This is crazy. It invites some thought into how my code works versus the limitations of what I can visualize.</p>
                
                <p>For example: if I code a for loop to iterate up to a number, it will only take a short amount of time, but if I add a print command into the for loop’s body, the loop will have finished, but there will be a lot of print commands queued up. The printing process takes far longer than the actual cpu process of counting. </p>
                
                <p>Finished the Promises section. Feeling good about the time spent here. I added the async.js and promises.js files I created to my Reference Project directory.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: ChatGPT Project #1</h3>
                <p>I started working on this tutorial a few days ago. I am continuing it now. The tutorial is <a href="https://youtu.be/2FeymQoKvrk" target="_blank">walking me through building a code generator app that utilizes ChatGPT in the background</a>.</p>
                
                <p>The project uses Vite, which seems to be s simple way to generate a static site. I’ve never used Vite. It seems easy. This will be interesting to see how it is utilized here.</p>
                
                <p>All the css and html are provided, but I still took a little bit to read through it. I like reading other html and css. It gives me ideas and it’s good practice as I am constantly thinking through the layers and identifying what declaration is doing what and how is it affecting what’s around it. </p>
                
                <p>When I don’t understand something I will isolate it out and build it in my playground project.</p>
                
                <p>I also like commenting out lines that don’t seem like they are doing anything. It’s fun to either see when a specific declaration becomes relevant or to find code that doesn’t need to be there. </p>
                
                <p>After spending some time with the html and css, I then got lost in the JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>By ‘lost’ I mean going on detours myself, which tend to lead to other detours. These detours occur because this is how I do tutorials: The tutorial describes what a function is going to do and then I pause and go off to build that functionality myself. I don’t think it’s a bad thing to do this, until it is. </p>
                
                <p>The first function that led to a detour was creating a loading function. This functions job is to animate a ‘…’ one dot at a time. This was a good moment for me to practice all the async JS I have been learning. I created this, then compared and was happy to see the instructor had a very similar solution. </p>
                
                <p>The next function was a text typing function. A string is the argument and that argument is then displayed one letter at a time in the display section of the UI. </p>
                
                <p>I coded this myself as well and doing so made me very happy. It was another opportunity to not only exercise the async JS by way of setInterval, but also reinforced my learnings about closures.</p>
                
                <p>The next function was a random number generator, which is  a simple thing, but my mind took it a bit further. </p>
                
                <p>First I explored the Number.toString(\#) feature, which allows us to easily take a number using a different Number system. </p>
                
                <p>The random number generator spits out a decimal number. I wanted a function to take that random number and move the radix so the long decimal becomes a really big integer. </p>
                
                <p>The problems: 1) determine how many digits the number is; 2) create a function that will move the radix by the number of the digits in the input. </p>
                
                <p>The first problem is just me saying, yes I can make a function that is for numbers of a certain digit-length, but wouldn’t it be neat to be able to convert any number from a decimal point to a non-radix number? Perhaps.</p>
                
                <p>The problem with this is that I want to avoid data type conversion, as I know it is costly, and the challenge to figure that out without converting the number to a string to get its length property is fun.</p>
                
                <p>I ended up settling for the data conversion as it was leading me further astray than I wanted to be. </p>
                
                <p>The next little function I made based off my own side-exploration was to create a function that would generate a number that would shift the radix by a certain amount. It takes in as an argument, the number of spaces one wants to shift the radix by. The return value is simply a 1 with however many zeroes appended to it.</p>
                
                <p>For this one I did not use type conversion. I used a simple for loop that multiplies by 10 and whose iteration count is the argument. </p>
                
                <p>For this function to work its return value would be multiplied by the number whose radix is being shifted. So I created a function to do this. Of course this function has nothing to do with the original project as the generated number will be in hexadecimal format. </p>

                <h2 class="date">January 22, 2023</h2>
                <p>What I have been working on is a project that shows the purpose of the setTimeouts and how they work from a user interface perspective. </p>

                <p>I created a rough interface with a button to click and there’s a counter for how many times it has been clicked.</p>
                
                <p>I have 4 buttons to run a specific process. The first button runs the ‘hungry’ process, which doesn’t use any setTimeouts at all. Engaging this button then clicking the counter button gives a discernible lag between the clicks and the counter. </p>
                
                <p>The other 3 buttons break up the process into pieces, and there is no lag in the Click Counter because the nested setTimeouts provide an opportunity for other code to be run.</p>
                
                <p>The difference in the buttons has to do with how the process runs.</p>
                
                <p>The mechanics of emulating a process in this app involves a loop and counting up to a certain number (the process appetite). If the appetite is larger, the process takes longer.</p>
                
                <p>The functions triggered by these latter 3 buttons involves a total appetite size and a chunk size. </p>
                
                <p>The first counts up to the appetite size even when there’s only a leftover amount that’s less than the chunk size. The second button will only count up to the size of the remainder of the appetite, if it is less than a chunk size.</p>
                
                <p>Even though this process emulation isn’t too real-world-y I also saw there was an opportunity to make the process more efficient. Making things more efficient is definitely real-world-y.</p>
                
                <p>An interesting trade-off I noticed:</p>
                <p>The chunk size is important; too small of chunks the code takes longer. Too large of chunks, then it defeats the purpose of chunking the process to begin with. The best chunk size is somewhere in the middle. The chunks are large enough to reduce the number of times the code has to run, the chunks are small enough to provide space for other things like clicking, etc to be accounted for and allowed to run. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Continuing with Promises today. Yesterday I spent some time reviewing my old notes on Async JS and updating them. </p>
                
                <p>What I hope I can clear up is how this Fetch API works in regards to micro and macro task lists. I know that fetch utilizes promises, but because fetch also utilizes the Network Request feature of the Web Browser I think there is something else going on.</p>
                
                <p>I just looked it up. Fetch requests create a new macrotask list/queue and it is here that the microtasks that result from the fetch’s promise get added. </p>
                
                <p>I found <a href="https://javascript.info/event-loop" target="_blank">an interesting article on macrotask and microtask lists and the event loop</a>. I think the examples are good and I am spending some time working through them to improve my understanding of how these work. It is a bit of a side adventure, but I sense it may pay off by improving my understanding of how async works and what its purpose is.</p>
                
                <p>One aspect that this article has revealed to me is that when blocking code is running, it is blocking listeners from being able to do their things, such as mouse movement, clicking, etc. These events are hyper-related to a user’s experience. Having these interactive listeners be blocked results in poor user experience. Being able to bump a long running task to the background and periodically giving moments for code that would be blocked to come up and ‘breathe’ so to speak greatly improves user experience.</p>
                
                <p>This notion of moments to breathe is interesting to me as well. This is what setTimeout allows us developers to do. We can use loops that run a chunk of the blocking code, then after the chunk runs, the next chunk is scheduled to run with a setTimeout and this allows other code that was blocked to run before the next chunk of blocking code runs. I have never thought of it like this, but I think it is a useful piece to add to my mental model. </p>

                <h2 class="date">January 17, 2023</h2>
                <p>I recently finished reading <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/" target="_blank">Quincy Larson’s book on learning to code and landing the first developer job.</a>. This was an inspiring and helpful read and confirmed an idea that I had, that learning for the sake of learning isn’t useful. What’s useful is building out projects. Finishing a project from start to finish. Taking one’s time within the project, being patient and sensitive to ideas, inspirations, ah-ha moments. Using the project itself as the guide on what to learn, that way what is learned is being applied in a practical way.</p>

                <p>I also think that rebuilding a project over at least twice (more depending on the complexity) is good strategy that I need to implement. We can see more fine details by doing this. Just like anything first encountered and then encountered again.</p>
                
                <p>The book also confirmed my notion that I need to get out there and meet some coders, join some Hackathons, start listening to coding podcasts, immerse myself into the mindset and tribe.</p>
                
                <p>I don’t know what the purpose of this coding journal is just yet. I don’t know if I will be continuing it. I do feel it is a nice way to practice writing, though I wonder what kind of habits I am building because the writing itself isn’t that great. </p>
                
                <p>We will see. For now, the Coding Journal continues.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>This course has already helped me a lot in regards to my fundamental understanding on how JavaScript works. More importantly I am working on a project that allows me to apply the learnings. </p>
                
                <p>I think at this time a review of what I learned so far would be good. </p>
                
                <p>The first thing that was hammered in was the importance of being able to communicate in a technical manner. Throughout the course this was practiced. I can now describe line by line what is occurring. </p>
                
                <p>The 3 Pillars of JavaScript is a good mental model that was hammered on as well. The pillars being: thread of execution, storing data and code in memory, call stack. </p>
                
                <p>While learning this the use of the word ‘scope’ became more clear to me. ‘Scope’ specifically refers to stored value access. It works in a bottom up sort of way. A scope can reach up to its parent scope, but cannot reach down into children scope. </p>
                
                <p>I have a better understanding of how callbacks work. I clearly understand now that what a callback is is a function passed into a Higher-Order function. Callbacks and Higher-Order functions go hand in hand. The Callback is the argument of the Higher-Order function. Can one exist without the other? I am not sure. I do see that they clearly need each other. </p>
                
                <p>I have learned about closures and how these work. I can say what a closure is: A function that is returned by another function. In a way it’s sort of an opposite of a Higher-Order function, although Higher-Order functions can result in closures. </p>
                
                <p>I clearly understand how closures work with the Persistent Lexical Scoped Referenced Data i.e. the backpack of variables that go along with the returned function. </p>
                
                <p>This layered functional process is still challenging for me, especially when a Higher-Order function takes in a callback as an argument, then returns that callback wrapped in a closure. But the blurry image in my mind of what is happening with this is becoming a bit clearer, especially as I use it.</p>
                
                <p>I learned about asynchronous JavaScript. My mental model of the entire runtime within which JavaScript plays out has become much more clear. I know more clearly now that there are many functions, like fetch and setTimeout, that look like JavaScript, but whose functionality occurs outside of JavaScript itself, usually within the browser via Web APIs. Many of these functions help JavaScript do the things it cannot do on its own and give JavaScript its asynchronous capabilities. </p>
                
                <p>The JavaScript Runtime: JavaScript engine, which consists of the call stack and the heap. The 3 pillars of JS are encompassed within these two things. Outside of the JavaScript engine we have the Callback Queue, which is filled up by functions that work via Web APIs (setInterval and setTimeout, for example). Going along with the Callback Queue is the Event Loop, which is constantly whirring, checking the callstack and adding into it callbacks waiting within the Callback Queue when the current callstack is emptied. </p>
                
                <p>Explaining these things is still a bit fuzzy, but the whole process itself is so much less so.</p>
                
                <p>I am now in the process of learning about Promises. What I like about Will’s presentation is he is directly tying Promises to the Web API fetch function, which performs one of the most important non-JS tasks within any internet based environment: making Network Requests. </p>
                
                <p>What I’ve learned about Promises so far: It is a two pronged ‘facade’ function (the name Will gives those functions that look like JS, but really call upon Web APIs to do stuff outside of JS). The first prong is it takes in a web address in order to make the Network Request. The second prong is like the bit which catches the Request once the server sends it back. It is a JS object (actual JS, not ‘facade’ JS) with two properties: ‘value’, and a hidden property called onFulfilled, which is an array and holds the callbacks that will be run once the Request is fulfilled. </p>
                
                <p>Promises are always in one of 3 states: pending, fulfilled, rejected.</p>
                
                <p>And this is where I am picking up today.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Brilliant.org</h3>

                <p>Today’s section is all about naming. Though this course is about computer science in a more generalized manner I find it helpful to see the teachings in the context of JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>This section describes how names are there to make values more memorable and retrievable. The values are more easily read by computers, the names by humans. In order to bridge the gap between the two, there needs to be a system that resolves names to the values.</p>
                
                <p>This makes me think of variables in JavaScript, DNS for the internet, phone books for phone numbers (I know, getting pretty antiquated here). </p>
                
                <p>The section describes the importance of having some central authority to do the resolving so that names are consistent with the values. There are pros and cons with the pros outweighing the cons for the most part.</p>
                
                <p>One of the cons has to do with time required to respond to a request. This is definitely something browsers, servers and clients deal with. One of the ways this problem is reduced is by way of caching. Caching simply stores the response from previously made request.</p>
                
                <p>Of course adding a cache can create its own issues such as having an out of date cached item, or potentially making a system slower because a cache must be check first before making a request. With that said, for the most part, caches are useful and beneficial.</p>
                
                <p>Caches remind me of Memoization in JavaScript. It seems these are the same thing, perhaps with Memoization being a more specific form of caching.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Continued with the async practice problems from the course. Realized that the strange behavior I was experiencing yesterday with setTimeout and setInterval were in fact due to caching issued in Chrome. Love the relevancy of that.</p>
                
                <p>Moving forward with the Promises section of the course. This will be more review, but I am looking forward to it. </p>
                
                <p>I have already learned about the terms Macrotask list and Microtask list and I know that before moving to a new Macrotask list (which would be created by a browser Timer function like setTimeout or setInterval) the Microtask list is cleared. I know that Promises occur within the Microtask list.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>Will Sentance describes Promises as a two-pronged ‘facade’ function. By ‘facade’ function he means those things that look like JS, but are actually done by the browser using lower level languages supplied by the computer on which the browser operates. Things like setTimeout. It looks like JS, but is not JS, is a ‘facade’ function.</p>
                
                <p>The 2 prongs of the Promise facade function are the network requests, which occur in the background, and the immediately return JS object. The JS object has state. The states are unfulfilled, fulfilled and rejected. </p>
                
                <p>The specific function he is referring to is the ‘fetch’ function. I think he makes an important point in saying that JS does not have the ability to make Network Requests. This is what the ‘fetch’ facade function allows us to do. One of the prongs is the Network Request, the other prong is the object that is immediately returned by the function into JS territory. It is this facade function that lets us do things with the internet within JS territory.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>Random thoughts hitting me: The beauty of async JS is that it allows the code that’s already there and ready to be run, to run without being blocked by the code which is going to take time.</p>
                
                <p>The code that takes time is generally in the form of a Network Request. I am now remembering what I learned a couple days back how a professor of Computer Science carried around with her a 30cm (I think?) length of copper cable, which equated to a nanosecond. Yes, this is super fast to us humans, but it is time nonetheless. It may seem instantaneous to us that a website responds, but what is happening is electricity is being moved along a wire across the globe and in response to the this electricity, some more electricity is being sent back. </p>

                <p>I am just not sure if this coding journal is being of any benefit. I guess it is in some ways. But this has been behind the lack of entries. </p>

                <p>I started using the <a href="http://Brilliant.org" target="_blank">Brilliant.org</a> application to learn about Computer Science and this has made me see JavaScript in new ways in that I have another perspective of things like loops and functions and why the DRY principle is important. </p>
                
                <p>I went over a module on Parallelism and Resource Tradeoffs. Parallelism isn’t so applicable to JavaScript because JS in single-threaded, but I have appreciation for the decision to make it so. Keeping multiple threads in sync, on the same page and things like cache invalidation are not easy to surmount. </p>
                
                <p>Resource Tradeoffs had to do with the two main resources of Time and Space. We have limitations and generally if we want something to be faster we need more space and if we have more time (i.e. things don’t need to be done as quick as possible) then less space is okay. Obviously this is tremendously oversimplified, but it is a concept that is at the heart of designing computers. </p>
                
                <p>I have not been moving forward with the FEMasters The Hard Parts v2 for the last few days (or at least as much as I would have liked), but I still review the foundational concepts I have learned so far on a daily basis. I am looking forward to getting back into it today.</p>
                
                <p>I have been learning more about AI. Specifically about ChatGPT and Midjourney, getting a feel for how these work and thinking about how these systems can be leveraged. I have also been reading articles about the pitfalls and weaknesses of such tools. For sure, the tools are here to stay and will change more. I am ultimately excited about them and glad I have started learning about JS and coding when I did. I am not so entrenched in the skills as to feel my skills are now being replaced, but rather am new enough with enough of an understanding to learn how to interact with these to build tools that can help others. That’s the plan and I am excited by it.</p>
                
                <p>What’s cool is that for sure knowing JS is still a crucial part of building an app/tool to work with these AI systems. </p>
                
                <h2>Learning: Brilliant Computer Science Path</h2>
                <p>Today’s section is on Order and Search. Ordering and searching go hand in hand with one another. How a collection of items is ordered is a strategic choice to help one search.</p>
                
                <p>Even with an order strategy determined, there are strategies to search. One such search strategy is the one involving splitting collections in the middle to progressively eliminate where a thing isn’t to get closer and closer to where it is. </p>
                
                <p>Choosing how items in a collection are to be ordered depends on the situation. I deal with this quite often when it comes to my digital note library. Some things are organized by topic (like JavaScript) and then within that note there are sections devoted to sub-topics (like Objects and Functions). Some things are organized in alphabetical order (like a Notes Table of Contents). Deciding how to organize can be difficult for sure.</p>
                
                <p>Being that computers deal with information it makes sense that at the heart of computers exists some way to organize and search through data, especially given how much data can be stored. </p>
                
                <p>Computers generally have two main ways of searching: searching through all files, which a computer can do very quickly. Or by consulting an index file of some sort. Both of these methods were evolved by way of libraries.</p>
                
                <p>Back to my notes and their organization: The way I generally find notes or information within a note is not by hunting the topic, but rather by searching in general. It invites me to ask: What is the point of organizing at all when I can just search? However, sometimes I don’t know exactly what I want, and having things grouped together can invite me to find something I didn’t even know I was looking for. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>I continued with he course. I did wrap up the async section a couple days ago and am ready to start the Promise section, but before doing so I wanted to go through the async practice problems.</p>
                
                <p>Due to my prior learnings in async JS I was able to move through many of the problems pretty smoothly, however I had to slow down as I was getting some unexpected behavior. I am still not sure if the issue is browser wackiness, but I have learned to assume that it is probably a misunderstanding in my code.</p>
                
                <p>One way I feel confident in the above assumption is I have some consistency in behavior. One of the benefits of Will’s course is that he teaches how to work through something line by line in a way that is accurate to what is actually occurring. </p>
                
                <p>On a different note I did have a realization in regards to the closure callback function I created awhile back now, which made use of the apply() function method and how to make it more generalized in regards to the number of parameters the callback took.</p>
                
                <p>Realized I didn’t need the apply() method at all and it was simply a matter of using the spread syntax in the closure’s parameter definition that made it work. So that was something. I spent a bit of time mulling this over only to realize it was doing too much. Still, there was value. I now have a waaaay better understanding of how the apply(), call(), and bind() function methods work. </p>

                <p>Yesterday I was sick. Could not work on anything as I was totally dysfunctional. Glad to have had the ability to take the day off. I am feeling so much better today.</p>

                <h3>Reading: Optimizing JS</h3>
                <p>I spent some time reading this awesome article on <a href="https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem/" target="_blank">speeding up the JavaScript ecosystem</a>.</p>
                
                <p>This was an excellent read for a number of reasons. First it reinforced certain programming fundamentals, such as type conversion is costly, and that computers work with numbers more efficiently than with strings. </p>
                
                <p>Second, it provided an example of a coder looking at existing systems, finding the inefficiencies and making these more efficient. This is a super valuable skill and one that has a lot of potential for contributing to open-source projects. On top of that it seems like it would be fun, like solving a mystery. </p>
                
                <p>The article also reinforced that at root what a computer is doing is moving data around. If data is in the form of strings, then there has to be a way to analyze those strings, converting human meaning into computer meaning. This is why computers work with numbers more effectively. That meaning conversion barrier doesn’t exist, or rather is much thinner, practically transparent in comparison. </p>
                
                <p>Another thing: a second may be fast in human time, but for a computer, that second is like, forever, man. So shaving seconds off a program or function’s run time really does add up. Plus, in a culture of dwindling attention spans, perhaps seconds are ticking by much slower than they once did and so perhaps the human-computer time perception is converging. </p>
                
                <p>All in all, this was a good read.</p>
                
                <h2>Reading: John von Neumann</h2>
                <p>Reading the article <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/john-von-neumann/" target="_blank">The World John von Neumann Built</a>. Today was more of a intake day than an output and learning day, though much learning was done via the reading.</p>
                
                <p>This article was about the scientist John von Neumann and is an excellent read and relevant to any coder (at least I think so).</p>
                
                <p>One specific topic that I found interesting was the idea of strategy and what it means. Von Neumann was a man who like to take chaos and filter it as much as possible through the lens of logic, and he did an excellent job at doing so. He wrote a paper on and is the father of game theory. </p>
                
                <p>Game Theory, from my own extremely naive understanding of it is about strategy, which is intrinsically linked with choice. Out of countless possible options, what are the best ways I can filter out the best choice to make at a given time. </p>
                
                <p>There is the chooser and that which is chosen against. That which is chosen against is an ever-changing landscape depending on the context. There are so many factors to take into account. This is why probability has a lot to do with it.</p>
                
                <p>A strategic choice is always the one that takes chaos and randomness and makes it more predictable. Each move made limits the choices to be made in the future in a way that is favorable to the chooser. </p>
                
                <p>A strategic choice involves predicting the behavior of that which we are choosing to thwart. </p>
                
                <p>Given a context that is filled with ever-changing variables and thus a context which can never be pinned down, it is useful to be able to define a simplified version. Doing so is usually anything but simple. </p>
                
                <p>This is one way, for me, that this ties in with programming. Whenever I am trying to understand a problem or how something is working (such as the function I have not yet broken down from 4 days ago now, but have been thinking about while walking or trying to sleep ever since) I know that breaking it down to a simplified scenario, controlling certain unknowns, is anything but easy, or simple. Yet the effort to do so is an effort undertaken by the greatest of thinkers to have ever lived.</p>
                
                <p>This is neat in that it is easy to see how far an away someone like von Neumann is to someone like me, yet the opportunity to practice one of the key abilities of one such as he surrounds me on a daily basis while trying to learn certain aspects of coding and how to apply coding to real world problems. </p>

                <p>In light of yesterday’s exploration in how to create a more generalized closure ‘factory’ that wraps a callback in such a way where when the instantiated closure is called, the passed in callback can only be called once, and subsequent calls will simply return the value returned by the first calling, I wanted to explore what I did in hopes of understanding how the heck it works. Because I didn’t understand it at all.</p>
                
                <p>I am planning on giving this a 45 minute burst of time each day for the next several days until I can confidently say “I understand this… better”.</p>
                
                <p>Today’s task involved trying to find a decent article that explains what the apply() method does. Though I read several articles, so far what I learned is that, unsurprisingly, the apply() method is related to the ‘this’ keyword, as well as the call() and bind() methods. I also learned that these are important methods in the land of JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>I started my journey updating my knowledge of how ‘this’ works. </p>
                
                <p>‘This’ is all about referring to the context. It is an implicit thing. Everything in JavaScript occurs within a context. The context ‘this’ refers to depends upon where it is being used. </p>
                
                <p>When used within a function body that is being called in the global scope, ‘this’ will refer to the global object, which, within a browser is the Window object (unless strict mode is being used, then what ‘this’ refers to is undefined). </p>
                
                <p>When ‘this’ is used within a method (which is just a function that is defined within an object), ‘this’ behaves the same - it refers to its containing context, which is the object within which the method lives. </p>
                
                <p>What I found interesting is that if ‘this’ is referred to as a property value, that value is the global object, even if the property value is within an object nested in another object. </p>
                
                <p>All of this ‘this’-ness makes sense to me. I have been learning JS for long enough now that certain things are becoming intuitive. This review helped me make it even more so.</p>
                
                <p>Now on to the fun part: the call() and apply() function prototypal methods.</p>
                
                <p>These make a whole heckuva lot more sense to me now and that is exciting! I see now that what these do is explicitly define the context of ‘this’. If I have a function that uses ‘this’ within its body and I want to change the referring context of ‘this’, then I can use call() or apply() and the first argument of these methods would be the object I want ’this’ to refer to.</p>
                
                <p>If I am not using ‘this’ within the function body, then the first argument would have no impact, whether I pass in an object or pass in the value ‘null’ or ‘undefined’.</p>
                
                <p>I also understand now what the second parameter of the call() and apply() methods want as an argument: they want the arguments of the function that the methods are being evoked on.</p>
                
                <p>Let’s say I have a function (a rather dumb one albeit) that takes in three arguments and prints a sentence using these arguments, as well as prints the context that ‘this’ refers to:</p>
                <pre><code>function callMe(name, age, number) {
                    console.log(this);
                
                    console.log(`Hi my name is ${name}, I am ${age}, and my number is ${number}. Call me, maybe?`);
                }</code></pre>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Calling this function in a normal way (without call() or apply()) would print the Window object and then would print the sentence based on the arguments passed in.</p>
                
                <p>But if I wanted to change the context by using call() or apply() to do so, where would I pass in the actual arguments?</p>
                
                <p>This is where the second argument of these methods come in. I was confused by this, but am no longer so. Huzzah!</p>
                
                <p>The difference between call() and apply() is how the function’s arguments are passed in. Using call(), I would just pass in the arguments after the thisArg argument comma separated. With call(), the arguments are passed in as an array as the second argument of the method itself. </p>
                
                <p>Tomorrow I will continue this exploration by utilizing this newfound understanding to get a better grip on what the heck is going on within the closure I created yesterday. </p>

                <p>Continuing with the Async section of Will Sentance’s The Hard Parts v2.</p>
                
                <p>Learning that the Callback Queue is part of the runtime environment within which JS code is executed. It is not a part of JavaScript in and of itself, but is a crucial component to keeping order in regards to when asynchronous code will run. </p>
                
                <p>The component that ensures that the callbacks in the queue don’t get added to the call stack until the call stack is empty is the Event Loop.</p>
                
                <p>All these terms I have been hearing about for awhile. Now it seems like it is all coming together in more profound ways. </p>
                
                <p>The Call Stack itself is JavaScript, it is one of the 3 pillars. The Callback Queue is where callbacks go to wait. The Event Loop is what triggers the callbacks in the queue to be added to the Call Stack so they can be executed by JavaScript. The Callback Queue would be useless without the Event Loop. Both the Event Loop and the Callback Queue are part of the runtime environment within which JS runs. They are not JavaScript, but are very helpful components of the environment that make JavaScript run better. They are like the reservoirs of water that make the flowers of JavaScript bloom more fully.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts and Review</h3>
                <p>Regarding yesterday’s closure and callback exercise/challenge, what follows are some thoughts that are helping me mentally grasp what is happening. </p>
                
                <p>Within the closure ‘factory’ function, I find that returning an anonymous function instead of a function identifier makes more sense. I can visualize more easily what is occurring when an instance of the closure is created. </p>
                
                <p>Next, understanding that the callback the closure ‘factory’ takes in and the function the factory returns need to match in regards to the parameters. The parameter name doesn’t need to be the same within the closure factory, but the number of parameters ought to be the same.</p>
                
                <p>If I were to make a more generalized closure factory that takes in a callback and returns a closure with matching number of parameters, I would first grab the number of parameters within the callback (is this possible? I think it may be with the argument property), then create an array of the parameter names, spread this array within the closure’s parentheses. </p>
                
                <p>The question is: What changes? What is staying the same?</p>
                
                <p>This closure factory is taking in a callback and returning a closure that only allows the callback to be called one time. Every call after the first one returns the value of the first calling. That’s the purpose of this closure factory and the closure it returns. </p>
                
                <p>As of now, this ‘once’ closure factory will only work for callback arguments that only have one parameter. This is due to the definition of the closure. It is too specific in the closure parameter definition. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>After a little bit of research I did manage to find a way to make this more generalized. With that said, I don’t quite understand what exactly is going on. It involves the use of the Function.prototype.apply() method. </p>
                
                <p>The original ‘once’ closure factory (the more specific one) looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code>function once(func) {
                    let count = 0;
                
                    let value;
                
                    //Notice that the defined parameter 'arg' is setting up and limiting the returned closure to be able to only accept one argument when an instace is called.
                
                    return (arg) =&gt; {
                        if (count === 0) {
                            
                            value = func(arg);
                
                            count++; 
                
                            return value;
                
                        } else {
                            return value;
                        }
                    };
                }</code></pre>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>The more generalized ‘once’ closure factory looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code>function generalizedOnce(func) {
                    let count = 0;
                
                    let value;
                    
                    //The identifier that will store the parameters:
                    let params;
                
                    //Storing the original callback function:
                    let originalFunc = func;
                
                    func = function() {
                        //This line of code is being added to the callback via the apply() method below. It is grabbing the arguments and creating an Array of them, then assigning this array to the params identifier. 
                        params = arguments;
                
                        //I don't quite understand what is going on here...
                        return originalFunc.apply(null, arguments);
                    }
                
                    //spreading the array of the callback's arguments
                    return (...params) =&gt; {
                        if (count === 0) {
                
                            //storing the value of the callback when it is called with all its arguments
                            value = func(...params);
                            
                            count++; 
                
                            return value;
                        } else {
                            return value;
                        }
                    };
                }</code></pre>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>The above has revealed to me an area I need more understanding on (the .apply() method) and it has also bolstered my confidence. The pseudo-code I wrote above was actually doable, which shows that my thought process is not super crazy. This was also an instance of not knowing how to do something, but exercising the research muscle to find the answer and implementing it. </p>
                
                <p>I did not just copy and paste the answer either. I had to take the answer and make adjustments to it. I had to place it within my specific environment. I also changed the first argument of the .apply method. The answer utilized the ‘this’ keyword. I changed this to null and it still worked. Again I don’t exactly know why it worked with or without ‘this’, but I feel happier to not have a frivolous argument being passed in nonetheless.</p>
                
                <p>With that said, something interesting is definitely happening here and it is, like, way over my head…</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>It is time to continue with the course and moving on to the Asynchronous section of the course.</p>
                
                <p>Today was a lot of review, but not just review, a new perspective on information I have taken in previously. This means there is value!</p>
                
                <p>The new perspective gained is that JS needs help in order to do things in an asynchronous manner. Where that help comes from is the environment within which JS was created for: The Web Browser.</p>
                
                <p>The Web Browser runs on the computer and so therefor has access to lower languages and can therefore do things that our single-threaded JS cannot do on its own. </p>
                
                <p>There are many ‘facade functions’ that look like JS, but are only means for JS to interact with these outside helper features. These features are things like Web APIs, the Timer feature, Dev Tools (such as console, which we all know and love so very much), the ability to render web pages in the first place (HTML DOM) and the feature which makes the Browser itself relevant: Network/HTML requests. </p>
                
                <p>Today we went over the ‘facade function’ setTimeout and Will explained what is going on when this function is called in a way I haven’t encountered yet which helped my understanding a lot.</p>

                <p>Woohoo! The new year is here and all the holiday madness is done and over, other than putting away all the decorations, which is an opportunity to set up next year’s process. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts and Review</h3>
                <p>Since I’ve been away from the coding for the last couple days I figure I would spend a bit of time here revisiting what I have been learning. With that said, during my morning walk I like to review, so even though I haven’t been learning new things, I have been consolidating and ingraining the information. </p>
                
                <p>I like the framework of the 3 pillars that Will Sentance established for me. The first pillar is the Thread of Execution. This is the flow through which JavaScript runs its commands. There is only one thread and it flows line by line. There are ways to manipulate the flow, sending some processes to the back of the line, or the bottom of the call stack, but it only ever flows in a single thread, line by line. </p>
                
                <p>I do have some thoughts on this and it has to do with the term Execution Context. It seems to me that the thread of execution makes up one part of all execution contexts. The other part of this is the memory associated with the execution context. </p>
                
                <p>There is the global execution context, which is the main execution context within which everything occurs. This means there is the global thread of execution and global memory. </p>
                
                <p>There is the local execution context, which is created by the calling of a function. Every function call creates a local execution context, with a local thread of execution and a local memory. </p>
                
                <p>The ordering of how these execution contexts run is kept in check by the Call Stack (one of the three pillars). I know that the call stack works in conjunction with what is called the Heap. I have learned about these things a bit ago and so my knowledge isn’t so up to date. I will be looking into these further. I know that the browser provides a lot of additional supporting aspects, such as Web APIs, the event loop and the callback queue. But again these are things I will be learning about more. </p>
                
                <p>The last thing I want to touch on is closures. Specifically, that there are two distinct phases of closures: defining the function that returns the closure and creating an instance of the closure. </p>
                
                <p>The more I see closures in action (and at this point, this hasn’t been a whole lot) the more I am reminded of classes. Classes too have these two distinct phases, defining the class and creating an instance of it. They are similar. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>What I did today was continue with the challenges. I first revisited the callback challenges, which served as good review. I reworked the challenge I did the last time with the intersection and the union algorithms, but this time using the reduce and filter methods.</p>
                
                <p>This was a good exercise and the more I do this the more I get better at thinking in loops and tracking what is going on. It is still challenging, but much less so. </p>
                
                <p>Next, I revisited the closure challenges. This was… challenging. The challenge that challenged me, and still is challenging to me, is one that defines a function which returns a closure. The closure is one that takes in as an argument a callback and its purpose is to condition this callback in a way where it can only be called once. The first time it runs the code. The second time it just returns the value that was returned the first time no matter the argument passed into it. </p>
                
                <p>This required some mental aerobics and time away for processing to occur. I was out shopping and while driving back something clicked. I really enjoy these kinds of moments. </p>
                
                <p>I realized that one thing I do is try to generalize too much. This is what made the task harder for me. Now I realize that closure ‘factories’ are going to be specific to the closure they generate. </p>
                
                <p>In this case, with the closure ‘factory’ that was challenging me, the returned closure must contain as many arguments as the function passed in as an argument has parameters. Yeah. That sentence is a mind twister in and of itself. Such is coding. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Continuing on with the Closure section of this course. </p>
                
                <p>I learned the technical name for the ‘backpack’ of stored data that comes with the closure is itself called a closure. This is, to me, not the best term.</p>
                
                <p>With that said, Will has a neat term for it, other than ‘backpack’, that I like much better as it is more descriptive: Persistent Lexical Scope Referenced Data.</p>
                
                <p>Persistent because the data within this special storage area does just that: the state of the data is saved and can be read and updated as needed. </p>
                
                <p>Lexical Scope because the data stored follows JavaScript’s rules regarding scoping and what variables and constants are accessible. </p>
                
                <p>Referenced Data because only the data that the function itself references goes into this storage area. I think this optimization is neat. At the same time it follows programming best practices regarding the prevention of memory leaks. </p>
                
                <p>Lastly, this label for this storage compartment sounds smart. It could be impressive to use in an interview. Of course, to use it and not know what each of the components of the term itself means would not be so smart. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>I also learned through exploring myself and then having Will go over what I was exploring is that these functions that create closures are closure factories. Each time the function is called and the closure is stored with a new identifier creates a new instance of that closure. Multiple instances of the same closure do not interfere with one another.</p>
                
                <p>I am seeing a lot of connections between closures and objects. They seem so very similar. One big difference is that a closure cannot be edited and changed like objects can be. </p>
                
                <p>Hmmmm… perhaps the code within a closure is similar to how static properties and methods of a class work. Static properties and methods cannot be accessed by an instance of the object created by the class. Only the non-static properties and methods can be changed. I am just spit balling here. Even if I am wrong, just the act of being wrong and then later being corrected means that information becomes extra sticky. I don’t know why that is, it just is. I have learned this through a lot of experience of having this be the case.</p>
                
                <p>We can’t be afraid to be wrong. We should be wary of needing to be right though. Another way of saying that is being resistant to being corrected. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>The more I think about closures the more the make sense. If a function is being returned by an ancestral function, then whatever variables, constants, functions, objects, etc that were not declared within that closures body, but make reference to the data must come with the function definition for that function definition to be functional. If they didn’t ride along with the function definition in the Persistent Lexical Scope Referenced Data area, then when the closure is called, there would be an error.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts and Review</h3>
                <p>I was thinking about what I have been learning the last weeks and months about Javascript. I mentally go over the concepts. I take walks and review while walking. I have dreams about JavaScript… </p>
                
                <p>I was thinking about the second pillar of JavaScript, which is storing data and code in memory. I was thinking about the term ‘variable’ which is used a lot of the time to describe a piece of data being stored in data. I sense that using this as an umbrella term is okay, but it is also inaccurate. </p>
                
                <p>Technical communication is important and so I feel accuracy is important as well. A variable is assigned a value only when the keyword ‘let’ (or the now antiquated ‘var) is used. This is a variable because the value assigned to it can vary. This is accurate.</p>
                
                <p>But when we say a variable is declared when we use the keyword ‘const’ this is not accurate. What is declared with the keyword ‘const’ is not a variable, but a constant. Its assigned value cannot change. A constant variable is an oxymoron. </p>
                
                <p>Perhaps the above can be considered as huffy and snobby, but I don’t think so. I am liking more and more the idea of accurate description and communication. I think this will set me above others when I begin to apply for that hard to hunt, ever elusive, first job as a web developer and coder. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>Storing stuff in memory comes in different flavors. We store primitive data and collections of both primitive data and code (objects). </p>
                
                <p>In order to store stuff in memory generally requires 4 components within the statement: keyword, identifier, assignment operator, the thing to be stored. </p>
                
                <p>The keyword will define the nature of the thing to be stored. There’s ‘let’ (and the antiquated ‘var’) for variables, ‘const’ for constants, ‘function’ for functions, ‘class’ for classes, etc. </p>
                
                <p>The identifier is simply the label applied to the wire. It allows us to summon up the thing that is tied to the identifier. Identifiers are crucial. Naming them is an art form and is one of the harder things when one is wanting code to be readable by one’s future self and others. </p>
                
                <p>The assignment operator (=) is what, in a sense, connects one end of the wire to the identifier and on the other side of the assignment operator is the data to which the other end of the wire is connected. </p>
                
                <p>This is what it takes to store ‘stuff’ in memory in JavaScript. </p>
                
                <p>I am still so grateful for <a href="https://justjavascript.com/" target="_blank">Dan Abramov’s Just JavaScript course</a> for helping me with creating more accurate mental models of how this works. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>Yesterday I started learning about closures. The term ‘closure’ is fine. It had to be called something. With that said I don’t think it hurts to use another term to describe these to myself. I think of them as bubbles. </p>
                
                <p>Closures are functions that were defined within another function’s scope and then that function definition is returned by the parent functions. All the data stored in the local memory of the parent function’s scope are forever intertwined with that returned function definition, even though the parent function’s locally scoped storage is deleted after that parent function’s execution context has run its course. </p>
                
                <p>This is interesting. I wonder where this stored stuff lives. It’s not within the global scope. It’s not within the parent function’s local scope which birthed and returned the function definition. Yet the state remains, persists.</p>
                
                <p>I will be learning more about this today, and I am excited. I am also concerned because learning this is fine and dandy, but as I said over and over, the real value comes through application. And yet, even without immediate application, when the opportunity for application comes, the learning of this now will aid me if I must review it in the future. There is still value in the learnings even without the immediate application. It’s just not ideal. And that’s okay.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>I have learned where a closures stored stuff lives. </p>
                
                <p>It is all about where a function is defined. If a function is defined within the global scope, there is no closure. Perhaps there is, but everything that would be stored in this special storage space is globally accessible. </p>
                
                <p>If a function is defined within an ancestral function’s body, then all the variables and constants created within that scope (there are caveats, which I haven’t gotten to yet) are connected to that function definition.</p>
                
                <p>If that function definition is not returned by the function then there is no closure. For the closure to exist that function definition must be returned by the ancestral function. </p>
                
                <p>When that ancestral function is called and the closure comes into existence and then that closure is called, the data are accessible within the execution context of that calling. </p>
                
                <p>It is where those data exist that is interesting. They don’t exist within the local storage of the execution context, though this is the first place checked when one of those stored data is summoned. Rather they exist in a special storage compartment. </p>
                
                <p>This special storage compartment is a hidden property of the function definition called <code>[[scope]]</code>. This is the next place that is checked after the local storage. </p>
                
                <p>This is similar, if not the same, as an object’s prototypal inheritance. First the local storage is checked, then the hidden property is checked. Multiple closures can exist and so each closure’s hidden property is check until the global storage is checked.</p>
                
                <p>This hidden property created by the closure is a permanent/persisting cache of data. It is also (and this is what makes it truly special) a private cache of data only accessible within the execution context of that closure. </p>
                
                <p>Pretty freakin’ neat. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Yesterday, the last thing from the second section was <a href="http://csbin.io/callbacks" target="_blank">a series of coding challenges</a> (<a href="https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/cs-bin-solutions/blob/master/callbacks.js" target="_blank">and here’s solutions to some of them</a>). I am going to spend a bit more time on them today. What I like about them is that they are opportunities to come to grips with how to write higher order functions. </p>
                
                <p>Writing higher order functions is different because the callbacks within the higher order functions leave room for functionality. Lower order functions are explicitly laid out, line by line. Higher order functions are not like this. </p>
                
                <p>With that said, the callback within the higher order function, though not specifically coded, does have some structure. The parameters have an order to them. Each parameter is expecting a certain type of data. </p>
                
                <p>This is why documentation is important. </p>
                
                <p>The challenges are neat because they have me recreating certain array methods, such as map, forEach, and reduce. This is a useful exercise and is boosting my understanding of how callbacks work, as well as what is going on under-the-hood of these array methods and why they are so useful. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>Coding out an intersection function which takes in an array of arrays and returns all the values that exist within every array.</p>
                
                <p>This was an interesting challenge. I utilized 3 for loops. The first loop grabs each individual array within the array of arrays. The next loop grabs each value within the grabbed array. The last loop grabs the next array in the array of arrays and checks it for the grabbed value.</p>
                
                <p>I used a counter variable (a state variable) and if the counter is equal to the length of the array of arrays minus 1 (in other words not including the current array), then that value is pushed to the array that will be returned.</p>
                
                <p>While doing this I discovered (or rediscovered) the ‘continue’ keyword. I like this keyword because it has the function of efficiency built within it. It allows me to stop an iteration and move on to the next iteration. This is different than the ‘break’ keyword which would break out of the loop altogether. </p>
                
                <p>I spent some time going through and finding ways to make the function more efficient, adding checks at certain layers to avoid unnecessary iterations. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>I started on the section about Closures. According to the instructor, Will Sentance, closures are one of those things where if I can come to grips with what it is doing, then I will know how JavaScript works in general. This is an exciting statement. I do not take it lightly.</p>
                
                <p>What I’ve learned so far is that what a closure is is essentially a function that is returned by another function. When a function is declared within the execution context created by the calling of another function, and that function definition is then returned, we have a closure. </p>
                
                <p>Due to my mental model which was corrected and cemented by the Just JavaScript course, I believe a lot of work will be saved in this adventure into understanding closures. </p>
                
                <p>The key part of that mental model is that the identifier is essentially a simple expression that expresses its assigned value/data. Along with numbers, strings, boolean, etc, function definitions are a value. </p>
                
                <p>When a function that was declared within the execution context created by the calling of another function is returned, it is not the identifier itself that is returned, though it may look like that. Rather it is the function definition that was assigned to that identifier. </p>
                
                <p>I know I am repeating myself here, but it is the repetition that helps with my understanding, as well as my technical communication capabilities (which I also mentioned yesterday).</p>
                
                <p>Now I think the most crucial part of understanding closures will be in their application. Knowing something technically is okay, but knowing how to use those things is truly awesome. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Before continuing, here is a bit of review of what I learned yesterday. Intervallic recall is the best way to retain.</p>
                
                <p>The 3 pillars of JS: Thread of Execution, Storing data and code in memory, call stack. </p>
                
                <p>The thread of execution is the line by line execution of code. This consists of storing data in variables and arrays, storing code in functions, and storing both within objects. </p>
                
                <p>The storing of data involves variables. Variables have 3 parts (this wasn’t mentioned in the course, but is my own observation). First, there is the identifier. Second, there is the “wire”. Third, there is the data. </p>
                
                <p>The identifier is the name of the variable. This, in a sense, is the key used to access the data wired up to the variable. The wire is created by the assignment operator - the good ol’ =. The data can be primitive or an object (including all the special objects - arrays, functions, etc). </p>
                
                <p>Storing data is crucial. Without this ability there would be no such thing as coding. </p>
                
                <p>The last pillar is the call stack. At the bottom of the call stack is the global() function. This is sort of like a constantly running while loop. While the call stack is empty, wait for something to be executed. Once something to be executed arrives, then execute the code, in order. </p>
                
                <p>When a function is called a new execution context is created. The execution context is a fractal of the global context in that it has its own local thread of execution and a local storage. </p>
                
                <p>Each execution context is added to the top call stack. The call stack is cleared from top to bottom. This is a useful mental model. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Yesterday I got to the Higher Order Functions section. Before actually getting to how Higher Order Functions work and why they are useful, we wrote out some functions that were very similar. They only changed by one character, which was an operator character (multiply, divide, add, subtract, etc.). </p>
                
                <p>It’s interesting to me because there is this principle in coding called DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). However, as a learning tool, repeating one’s self is actually crucial in understanding how NOT to repeat one’s self. </p>
                
                <p>By repeating ourselves (as a learning tool) we see what is changing and what is staying the same. This helps to reveal what can be parameterized. </p>
                
                <p>By repeating myself in the code I was able to see that the mathematical operators could be made into their own smaller, succinct and specialized functions and these functions could become arguments. </p>
                
                <p>When a function has a parameter that takes in a function as its argument, this function is called a Higher Order Function.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Created a cool Higher Order Function. Did it differently than the course. Made my utility functions (the lower order functions) even more general. They are using functions like multiplyBy2, but I made 4 functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide.</p>
                
                <p>These utility functions take in two arguments. The parameter names/identifiers are such that they use the technical names for the parts of the relative expressions. </p>
                
                <p>For example:</p>
                <pre><code>function divide(dividend, divisor) {
                    let quotient = dividend / divisor;
                
                    return quotient
                }
                
                function add(addend1, addend2) {
                    let sum = addend1 + addend2;
                
                    return sum
                }</code></pre>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>I had to look up what the names for the parts were. I figured if I am writing the function I may as well make it as specific as possible. </p>
                
                <p>By doing this I made these lower order functions even less specific. One can pass in two numbers, instead of only passing in one number. </p>
                
                <p>By doing this it meant that the higher order function needed one more parameter. The third parameter would be the number by which each value within an array would be changed by.</p>
                
                <p>The higher order function looks like so:</p>
                <pre><code>function copyArrayAndProcess(array, processor, processBy) {
                    const output = [];
                
                    for (let i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
                        output.push(processor(array[i], processBy));
                    }
                
                    return output
                }</code></pre>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>I think this is really cool. It’s a simple thing really, but by repeating myself at first I was able to see more clearly how I could strategically repeat myself less. I am not just doing what a person has said I should do, but doing it because of my own personal exploration and seeing why this is not only more efficient, but simply more pleasing aesthetically. </p>
                
                <p>Essentially, what the above function is is the map array method. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>More reviewing. Higher Order functions take in functions as arguments. These input/argument functions are… wait for it… callback functions.</p>
                
                <p>Higher order functions are also those which return a function. </p>

                <p>Had a nice 3-day holiday break. Time to get back to it. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Starting new course today. JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2. I have been looking forward to this course a lot. I was a bit impatient to get through the last one, but I think it was still valuable. My understanding of JS is getting stronger, but needs a lot of work still. I think the most important thing that I need to improve upon is actual application on all the levels: Functionality, Design (CSS), HTML. </p>
                
                <p>The first part of this course is a nice review and another way to cement certain terms, which are important to know and use for the sake of communicating clearly with other JS developers.</p>
                
                <p>The following is me using these terms to describe the basics of what JavaScript is doing.</p>
                
                <p>JavaScript involves two basic principles: thread of execution and storing data (memory). </p>
                
                <p>The nature of JavaScript is such that there is a single thread of execution. When we write JS code we are creating a line by line thread of execution. Each line is either storing some form of data or is executing an expression or statement. </p>
                
                <p>In regards to memory, the means to store data is variables. The properties of a variable consist of 3 things (as I see it): identifiers, a wire, and data. Identifiers are the names of the variables. These are used to summon the data. The wire is the connection between the identifier and the data. The data is that which is stored. This comes in many forms, but essentially is either a primitive data type, of which there are 7 flavors, or an object, of which there are various flavors, such as functions. </p>
                
                <p>Functions are special kinds of objects. When a function is declared a block of code is being wired up to an identifier. Parameters are also declared (they are not required, but are an essential property of functions). </p>
                
                <p>Parameters are special kinds of variables. They too consist of identifiers, wires and data. They are special because they are not yet wired up to data. They are waiting for the connection to be made. They are also special because they can only be used within the execution context of the function body.</p>
                
                <p>In order for the execution context of the function to be run, the function must be called. This is when those parameters are wired up to data or expressions that express data. The actual data that is wired up to a parameter is called an argument. </p>
                
                <p>When a function is called the stored block of code runs, creating a new thread of execution within the grand/global thread of execution. A function’s execution context is like a bubble. Within this bubble a new scope, a local scope, is created. </p>
                
                <p>Local scopes have access to the variables that were created in the global scope, but not vice versa. Local scopes are bubbles that pop. The global scope is a bubble that exists as long as the thread of execution of the code exists. It is the Grand Bubble, so to speak. Once it pops, all that was stored within memory within that bubble dies. However this bubble can be ran again and again. </p>
                
                <p>I am seeing how very fractal-like all this is.</p>
                
                <p>The Call Stack is how JS keeps track of what needs to run and when. JS can has only one thread of execution and can only do one thing at a time. The ordering of what runs when is crucial and the Call Stack ensures that properly written code will run in the right order. </p>
                
                <p>The global scope is the main thread of execution. Functions create local scopes which are execution context that grow like bubbles and then pop. As the bubbles grow certain things are occurring that are affecting what is happening within the global scope. After the bubble pops, JS moves on to its next task, but with an altered memory environment. </p>

                <p>Finished the FE Masters first JS course today. </p>
                
                <p>Wrapping up the dog quiz app by adding certain features, like adding styles for correct and incorrect guesses. This wasn’t covered within the course itself. </p>
                
                <p>I added the styling for correct and incorrect guesses. I then added functionality for adding the “Next” button. For this I created a simple utility function which took in as an argument the parent element to which the button would be appended to. </p>
                
                <p>Implementing this function on the correct guess path was simple. For the incorrect guess it was a little bit more involved. First I created a global state variable for guess count. Basically I wanted stuff to happen after 3 incorrect guesses. </p>
                
                <p>The stuff I wanted to happen was adding the correct class to the correct guess. This involved looping through the existing guess buttons to find the correct guess and then adding the correct styling to it. Then it was a simple matter of adding the Next button.</p>
                
                <p>The functionality of the Next button utilized the location.reload() method. I learned about this awhile ago when creating my <a href="https://chrissoncrant.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/" target="_blank">Rock, Paper, Scissors game</a>. I remember how much difficulty I was having at getting the game to reset, then while on a walk it hit me that I could just have the page refresh. Once home I googled how to do this and BOOM. Project complete. </p>
                
                <p>Of course it would be nice to add a score keeping functionality to this game, which would require having some way to store the score. I am thinking that there may be a way to do this without using a database to persist this data. Perhaps using the local storage or caching. I’ll have to look into this. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>The next challenge was getting this accessible on GitHub Pages. The challenge involved getting the file path in the link tag correct. Took me a couple shot. In the end the problem had to do with me not adding a ‘.’ in front of the relative file path. </p>
                
                <p>The problem with this was that when I would open with the live server it would work just fine. With GitHub pages it wouldn’t and each update and push took about 5 minutes before I could check to see if the change fixed it. </p>
                
                <p>All is working now. Plus the more I make these mistakes, the less I will make them in the future so I am grateful.</p>

                <p>Continuing with the dog quiz app. Finished setting up function to add the option buttons and basic functionality to check if the selected guess is correct.</p>
                
                <p>I then continued with the course videos. Reviewing async JS. The instructor is using the async await syntax. In my code I went with the Promise syntax, utilizing .then() methods on the Promise object. I am glad I did it this way because converting from Promise syntax to Async Await syntax is a good exercise as I know I will probably encounter both “in the wild”.</p>
                
                <p>Next up was reviewing destructuring syntax. What I did learn here is that when destructuring arrays a comma can be used to skip over values. This is useful if I know what index the value I want is. If the index is 4 and I don’t need the other values that come before it I would put in 3 commas before the variable name that I am assigning to the value I want: [,,, varaiableName]</p>

                <p>I did make some progress yesterday. Mostly this was studying the shuffling algorithm I found the day before yesterday (<a href="https://javascript.info/task/shuffle">Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm</a>). </p>

                <p>I spent some time exploring a couple things. First, how the destructuring syntax was working. This was confusing to me at first, but then I just took it apart in my head using the mental model that was ingrained via the Just JavaScript course I took a few months back. This cleared it right up for me. It’s all about knowing what is happening on either side of the assignment operator. </p>
                
                <p>The next thing I spent time exploring was the for loop within the algorithm. I wanted to know why it was stopping at the second item in the array. This was cleared up as I walked through what the algorithm was doing. It stops short because this algorithm is all about cycling through an array starting from the last item and randomizing the current index value with all the preceding items. The first item in the array has no preceding items. This is why it stops short. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>I worked through the first couple of TODOs on my own. This involved creating a function that would utilize my utility functions to take in 3 arguments (choice count, correct choice, array of possible choices) and return a randomized array consisting of the number of choices provided. </p>
                
                <p>I don’t know why doing things like this makes me happy, but it does. </p>
                
                <p>One thing I liked was being able to utilize the Set…Spread to make sure there were no repeat items in the returned array. I remember when this syntax didn’t make much sense to me, but now it makes sense. The syntax creates a new Set instance of the passed in array and then Spreads the values of this instance into a new array. </p>
                
                <p>This is done within a while loop which uses the array’s length as its stopping condition. </p>
                
                <p>At first I was wondering about the efficiency of this as it is creating a new array each time through the loop. I figure this would only be a problem if the array length was long. In this case, the array length will be 4 so I think the ‘inefficiency’ is okay.</p>
                
                <p>With that said I wanted to figure out another way to do this using conditionals. This utilized the .includes array method. Basically it will only push an item if it is not in the array. This works too. It does involve a similar thing in that each and every iteration within the while loop will still iterate over the array we are pushing to. I am not sure which method is more efficient. I am sticking with the Set…Spread for now though.</p>

                <p>Did not watch any of the videos today. Used my prior knowledge and the research skills to set up the image functionality.</p>
                
                <p>Last night I set up the fetching for the dog image. Today I used the async functionality (using the standard Promise syntax as opposed to the async-await) to set up the image element and add it to the page. </p>
                
                <p>Along with this I used string methods to pull out the breed from the URL. There is an array of BREEDS to check against. One hurdle was that the breed string within the URL is reverse from how the breeds are in the array. I set up a function to reverse the string and set up the filter array method to see if I could find the array item that matches. </p>
                
                <p>I used the variables I set up to create the image element. The page is now loading the images.</p>
                
                <p>The next step is to set up a function to pull out 4 items from the BREEDS array and create buttons with these, which will serve as the guesses. Then set up the click functionality for each button to check if the clicked button is the correct guess and style accordingly as well as appending a button which will refresh the page to bring in a new item.</p>
                
                <p>One feature that I don’t think is going to be addressed is adding some sort of score to keep track of. Looking forward to seeing how this moves forward. </p>

                <p>I am pretty sure I am sick. My energy is so low. I am going to do what I can today with what I got. I think that putting in at least an hour will make me feel a bit better, at least mentally.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Finished up the basic quiz app. </p>
                
                <p>Reviewed map and filter array methods, as well as template literals.</p>
                
                <p>Started the next project, which is another quiz project. This one is different because it is utilizing the Fetch API. I spent a bit of time in a side adventure reviewing the Fetch API, looking into the difference between static methods and instance methods. </p>
                
                <p>It’s been a number of months since I messed with async JS. I spent a lot of time in the passed getting introduced to it. What I know from experience is that the rewards of the time I put in in the past will be reaped as I start with this new encounter. </p>
                
                <p>Already I am seeing the rewards as the subtleties of how the Fetch API works in regards to static versus instance methods were not apparent to me  in the past. Now they are as I have more experience with classes in general.</p>
                
                <p>When studying classes I did have questions about what the heck a static method was and when would it be used and so this presents an opportunity to experience the actual use case for it. </p>
                
                <p>How I understand the difference at this point in time is that static methods are available when creating the instance, but are unavailable to the specific instance of the object once it is created. </p>
                
                <p>To be continued.</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JS Devs</h3>
                <p>Continuing with Module 5 on Responsive Design.</p>
                
                <p>Reviewing the CSS calc() function by way of creating some interesting generative art. Things get even more interesting when combining CSS Variables with the calc() function.</p>
                
                <p>I am seeing how this generation could be accelerated even more by way of adding some JavaScript to manipulate the values of the CSS Variables. This is giving me some ideas of some interesting ‘apps’ I could create that allows the user to enter in numbers that manipulate the art in a display box. </p>
                
                <p>I also read an article on CSS types. This was interesting. It introduced me to the concept of “strong” versus “weak” typed languages. CSS is a ‘strongly’ typed language, meaning that each property value needs to meet certain specs otherwise it will just be ignored. </p>
                
                <p>The next phase of today’s learning was about the viewport units. </p>
                
                <p>One takeaway for me is the problem that arises on mobile devices when one uses the 100vh value for creating a full height page/section. The sliding UI of the URL on mobile devices creates this dilemma. If one is using 100vh, then it’s important to know that the calculated height will be the full viewport height when the buttons and URL slide away. This means that when a page first loads and when a user scrolls up, there will be a shift in the layout. </p>
                
                <p>Another takeaway is how the vw unit does not take into account the scrollbar. I ran into this issue when coding up the Space Tourism website, when I implemented the responsive hamburger menu.</p>
                
                <p>This means that if the vertical scrollbar is present, there will be a horizontal overflow, causing the dreaded horizontal scrollbar to appear. There are work-arounds for this of course, but it may just be easier to avoid 100vw and use percentages instead. </p>

                <p>Over the course of the last 3-5 days I have been plagued with a sleeplessness that I am afraid is verging on insomnia. Yesterday and this morning I feel like a total zombie. It’s not fun. But I will make do with the energy I have. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JS Devs</h3>
                <p>Reviewing where I left off yesterday and the rest of the material from module 5 before continuing with it.</p>
                
                <p>Learned about CSS Variables. This is review for me, but still helpful. For instance I did not know that CSS Variables were, by default, inheritable to the element it is declared on, and all its children. </p>
                
                <p>This inheritance was sort of hidden from me due to the fact that when using CSS Variables I would declare them on the :root pseudo-element (funny that :root only uses one ‘:’ even though technically it should be two to stay consistent with other pseudo-elements)</p>
                
                <p>I also learned about a new at-rule that allows us to change this default inheritance and set other default values. This at-rule is the @property. This isn’t widely supported as yet, but it is good to know about I suppose. </p>
                
                <p>CSS Variables are pretty neat in that they allow for a single source of truth, which is generally a desirable trait within coding in general. With that said, sometimes it can be annoying to read CSS that uses a lot of CSS Variables as the actual value of the property using the variable is not evident. All that’s evident is that the value is being set by a variable and so to get what that value actually is one must search a bit further. It is good to know about this factor when it comes to deciding whether or not to use a CSS Variable to begin with.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Reviewing more conditionals as well as logical and ternary operators. I thought this would be a good time for me to review the short-circuiting effects of logical operators.</p>
                
                <p>When using an ‘and’ (&&) operator, if the first evaluated value is truthy, then the second value is returned. If the first value is falsy, then that falsy value is returned.</p>
                
                <p>With the ‘or’ operator, it is the opposite. Exactly. If the first evaluated value is truthy, that value is returned. If the first value is falsy, then the second value is returned.</p>
                
                <p>This is generally something that is still a bit fuzzy in my head to keep track of what exactly will happen. It is, however, easy to check and verify. </p>
                
                <p>As a whole, the ‘or’ operator evaluates to truthy if at least one of the values is true. The ‘and’ operator evaluates to truthy if both the values are truthy. </p>
                
                <p>It seems to me that these are two different things. Short-circuiting is used for assigning variables, whereas the evaluation of the whole logical operator expression is used within the parentheses of conditionals. </p>
                
                <p>On closer inspection, these aren’t separate at all. It’s just a matter of recognizing that the logical operators are a sort of two part expression. </p>
                
                <p>Within the parens of the conditional, if we are using the ‘and’ operator, if the first value is falsy, it makes sense to return that value, then that first value is evaluated and, on its own, will return falsy. With the ‘or’ operator, if the first value is falsy, then it makes sense to return the second value and have that value be what decides the truthiness/falsiness of the overall expression. </p>
                
                <p>It is now making a lot more sense to me. Again, it is all a matter of taking a layered expression and breaking it down through to the simplest expression which ultimately decides the value that is returned/assigned. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>Going over ‘for loops’. This is, as par for this course thus far, review. However, it is also an opportunity to become more familiar with the ‘for…of’ loop. </p>
                
                <p>‘For…of’ loops are useful for iterating over an entire array (and strings too!), one value (or character if a string) at a time. It is very similar (if not the same thing said differently) to how the .forEach() method works.</p>
                
                <p>One thing I looked up and knew, but still was fuzzy and am now less fuzzy on is the ‘for…in’ loop. Basically, it seems to me that ‘for…of’ loops are short-hand loops for arrays and strings and ‘for…in’ loops are useful for iterating over all the properties of an object. </p>
                
                <p>Digging a bit deeper, I see that the difference between ‘for…of’ versus ‘for…in’ has to do with iterableness. Arrays and strings are iterable, objects are not. </p>
                
                <p>It is another opportunity for me to revisit the technical terms of the ‘for’ loop. The syntax of the ‘for’ loop consists of the ‘for’ keyword, followed by, within parens, the initializing variable assignment, the stopping condition, and the iteration statement. This is all followed by the body of the ‘for’ loop, which is within a block scope (i.e. within curly braces). </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>Whilst doing the exercises for today, I learned that if I am to use a ‘for…of’ loop I must use the ‘let’ keyword within the parens, otherwise it will work in a way that is, at first, unexpected. I say ‘at first’ because if I break down what is happening if I don’t use the ‘let’ keyword, it actually makes sense the behavior I am witnessing. If I don’t use ‘let’ it behaves similarly to how it would if I were to use the ‘var’ keyword to declare a variable within the block scope. This is cool!</p>
                
                <p>One thing I am noticing about this ‘app’ at this point is that it is pretty simple in that there’s only one question and one answer to check against, but again, this is an opportunity to really simplify the steps in general. Complexity is best derived from simplicity. </p>
                
                <p>In this case, the one question would become an object within a larger array of questions. Of course the other element that is missing from this ‘app’ is the capability to move to the next question. </p>
                
                <p>I previously created a version of this ‘app’ that did do this, which I erased so I could follow along, so I don’t feel like I am missing out. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JS Devs</h3>
                <p>Redid one of the exercises from yesterday to get warmed up. Learned more about modals and the some of the important aspects of a modal. </p>
                
                <p>There are 5 things that were mentioned in making an accessible modal, which is not a straight-forward thing. </p>
                
                <p>When the modal is open, focus should be moved to the close button (usually a button at top right), focus should cycle within the modal, escape key closes the modal. When the modal is closed (after being opened) focus should return to the button which opened it initially. </p>
                
                <p>The last thing is to make the modal friendly to screen readers, it needs to be annotated that a user has been moved into a modal. This is accomplished by adding HTML attributes. These attributes are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>aria-modal=“true/false”
                    </li>
                    <li>role=“dialog”
                    </li>
                    <li>tabindex=“-1” (when aria-modal=“true”)
                    </li>
                    <li>aria-label=“title-of-modal”
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>I ended today’s adventure in Josh’s course by going over breakpoints. I can dig Josh’s philosophy of setting breakpoints within dead zones between device sizes (phones vs. tablets vs. laptops vs. desktops) versus setting them at device specific sizes (iPhone 12, etc). </p>
                
                <p>Generally different devices come in clusters of sizes. Instead of setting a breakpoint at a device specific size of say 375px, we would add in some wiggle room and make it 550px. This wiggle room would account for similar devices (bigger and smaller). Basically, similar devices should be falling within the middle of the breakpoint, rather than setting the edges of the breakpoints. </p>
                
                <p>The breakpoints Josh uses are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>0-550px — Mobile
                    </li>
                    <li>550-1100px — Tablet
                    </li>
                    <li>1100-1500px — Laptop
                    </li>
                    <li>1500+px — Desktop
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Spent some time revisiting my learning game plan this morning, which bites into the time I get to spend on CSS for JS Devs, but that’s okay. I feel refocused. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JS Devs</h3>
                <p>Continuing with module 5 on Responsive and Behavioral Design.</p>
                
                <p>To aid in my understanding of using media queries, when going through the exercises I am doing both mobile-first and desktop-first. </p>
                
                <p>What this entails is, generally, a swapping of where certain CSS declarations are made. I think it is a good practice as it reinforces the two methodologies. For instance, if I am going with a mobile-first approach then the media query will involve a min-width condition, whereas with a desktop-first approach it would be a max-width condition. </p>
                
                <p>To help with my mental model of these conditions (max-width versus min-width), it helps for me to say to myself something like “These styles will apply when a screen is at or above size of X” (for mobile-first and min-width condition) or “These styles will only apply when the screen is at or below the size of X” (for desktop-first and max-width condition).</p>
                
                <p>The min-width condition is easier, more intuitive (perhaps due to more familiarity with using it), than is max-width and so expressing the media query in a kind of pseudo-code to myself helps a lot. </p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>I like that Josh has introduced me to the ‘revert’ property value. I like this because it seems more flexible, less strict. </p>
                
                <p>For example, instead of using “display: none” and then changing it to “display: block” within the media query, the media query property would be “display: revert. “</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Reviewing scope. This is such a foundational concept of JS that I am happy to be reviewing this.</p>
                
                <p>Function calls create new scopes and the variables that are created within the function body are created only until the return value is reached, then the variables are removed (behavior changes depending on whether ‘let’ or ‘var’ are used to declare the variable). </p>
                
                <p>There is the Global Scope and then there are function body scopes. Globally declared variables are available to function body scopes.</p>
                
                <p>I am thinking of Russian nested dolls. That is a sort of mental model I have. Funny enough, after typing this the instructor made the same connection, so that was affirming. </p>
                
                <p>Declaring a variable using the ‘let’ keyword will allow for the changing of the assignment to that variable within narrower scopes.</p>
                
                <p>At first I thought this was good, but as the instructor continued, I can see a bit more how this could create issues downstream.</p>
                
                <p>This is why it is good to use ‘const’ by default. It is safer and it allows for the opportunity of intention to come in when it comes to changing a variable’s value, and why and where that variable was declared in the first place.</p>
                
                <p>———————————— </p>
                
                <p>‘var’ keyword</p>
                
                <p>To me this keyword is similar to the ‘==‘ equality in that it is not as strict, which means that weird things can arise.</p>
                
                <p>What I learned about is that the difference in behavior between ‘var’ versus ‘let’ has to do with Block scope, which is different than Function scope. </p>
                
                <p>This difference between function scope and block scope is interesting to me. Function scope seems to be a more specific kind of block scope. Not sure if this is correct. </p>
                
                <p>I know now that block scope has to do with the curly braces. Curly braces aren’t only used with functions - they are used with conditionals and loops, and objects and classes. This is why I feel like saying that Function Scope is a more specific type of Block Scope. There are many flavors of Block Scope. </p>
                
                <p>Within a block scope, that’s not a function scope flavor, if we declare a variable with ‘let’, a whole new variable will be created, even if a variable was declared using ‘let’ in the global scope. Whatever we do to this block-scoped variable will not affect the globally scoped variable, even though they have the same name. </p>
                
                <p>If we use ‘var’ to declare a variable within the block scope that has the same name as a variable declared int eh global scope of the same name, then within the block scope, the globally scoped variable will be accessed and affected, even though we used the ‘var’ keyword to try and create a whole new variable.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                <p>Next topic, which is more review, are Events. </p>
                
                <p>Events are essentially in-built conditionals. There are many events that can happen in a browser and each one is attached to a keyword (like ‘click’). Event Handlers allow us to say “If this kind of event occurs here, then do this stuff”.</p>
                
                <p>There are 2 essential components to events: listeners and handlers.</p>
                
                <p>Events are fired whether there is as ‘listener’ for it or not. The tree does make a sound when it falls in the forest, even if there are no ears to listen for it.</p>
                
                <p>We assign listeners to elements and then when that specific event occurs we can add a handler to it. The handler is the body of the conditional. </p>
                
                <p>Creating Event Handlers is like declaring a function and then assigning the calling of that function to the event itself. Each time the event is fired a new function scope is created and destroyed. </p>
                
                <p>While going through the exercises, I encountered a little ‘A-ha’ moment related to state. The insight was that state variables are generally going to be globally scoped, that way when the event is fired that state is checked against and updated. If the variable was declared within the function scope, there would be no state because every time the event calls the handler function, the state variable will be created anew with the original value, which would not be helpful.</p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                <p>I ended today’s FE Masters session by watching the first video on conditionals. This is super review. Almost too simple of a concept for me at this point. </p>
                
                <p>Conditionals introduce the concept of ‘truthy’ and ‘falsey’, which is also review for me.</p>
                
                <p>Coming up we will be learning about the Ternary operator which is still review, but is also a bit more complex. This complexity arises due to its quality of implicitness, whereas writing conditionals traditionally is more explicit. And just typing that last sentence was useful. </p>
                
                <p>There is always value to be found. The trick is how to find it. </p>

                <p>Things got busy in my neck of the woods. Back to it. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JS Devs</h3>
                <p>Started module 5 on Responsive and Behavioral Design. Learned a bit about how it was back in the day and how this notion of “responsive” design came about as devices changed (iPhone and iPads being the main causes). </p>
                
                <p>I love that Josh went over methods on how to test and use dev tools on mobile devices as I ran into issues with this in the past. He mentioned a couple useful tools.</p>
                
                <p>Next, we went into Media Queries, which was a lot of review. I agree that it is important, when using Media Queries, to stick to either a desktop or mobile first approach. Generally for me, this would be a mobile first approach, however I do appreciate that this would vary depending on the project. </p>
                
                <p>This is important so as to prevent mixing the use of min-width and max-width media queries, as this can get confusing, especially on larger projects. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Continuing with the quiz project. I messed around a bit on my own with creating functions that create elements, then playing with different approaches to adding those elements to a containing box using JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>I did have a working quiz, but I abandoned it for the sake of not getting too off track from the tutorial videos as I do want to keep pushing forward with these. I erased what I had and then coded up the basic project from the tutorial.</p>
                
                <p>A lot of this is very basic review, but I do feel like there is still value to be gained. With that said, the videos are being played at double speed because I am wanting to get to more challenging learnings. </p>
                
                <p>Started on reviewing what Functions are and what they do. More good review. Markers of my own development, revealing things that I don’t have to think about anymore. </p>
                
                <p>One thing I like about this course is how it is utilizing the JavaScript REPL that exists within the dev tool. I don’t use this that often, instead choosing to use the “Open with Live Server” functionality with VSCode and just refreshing the page. </p>
                
                <p>The REPL is very useful and I am not so used to it, so this one of those behind the scenes kinds of lessons I am learning even though the core of the material itself is review. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JS Devs</h3>
                <p>Today I decided to redo the last walkthrough video using his way for the practice of using different methods.</p>
                
                <p>While doing so I encountered the interesting relationship between ternary operators and short-circuiting logical operators. In one case he used the ternary operator and in another he used the short-circuiting. </p>
                
                <p>I tested and either way accomplished the task. </p>
                
                <p>I find these two methods of “choosing” in JavaScript interesting and still don’t quite get them, but get excited each time I get to use them and grow more familiar with them.</p>
                
                <p>There is a solid difference between the two methods for sure. The ternary utilizes a “third-party” to help make the decision between two other options. </p>
                
                <p>The short-circuiting depends on the truthiness of the first expression to determine which is returned. For the “and” operator, if the 1st expression is truthy then the second expression’s value is returned. For the “or” operator if the 1st expression is evaluated to truthy then that value is returned. </p>
                
                <p>I am not sure yet when to use which, if there is a difference in using either as long as they are set up correctly, and whether there are pros and cons in deciding to use the short-circuit method versus ternary, but I am glad to have encountered the question again.</p>
                
                <p>With this I have finished the 4th module!</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Continuing with the course, though I didn’t watch any of the videos yet.</p>
                
                <p>Instead I am moving forward with creating a functional quiz application. I am running into certain challenges, which I am enjoying trying to figure out. </p>
                
                <p>The current challenge involves removing answers from previous questions before loading in the potential answers for the next question. I am close, but there’s some basic thing eluding me. I know I can find the answer real quick with Google, but I want to think about it more. </p>
                
                <p>I did manage to solve the problem myself. After a short while of not thinking about it, the answer came to me. It involved using a while loop versus a for loop.</p>

                <p>Yesterday was Sunday. Spent the day watching football and basketball, continuing decorating for Christmas (this year seems to be harder than others for some reason) and then playing Cyberpunk 2077. It was a good day. Now back to it.</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JS Devs</h3>
                <p>Continuing on with Comeau’s solution videos.</p>
                
                <p>Finished Module 3 on flexbox. I feel I have a much fuller understanding of flexbox. I am sure I will forget some, but not all the way. There will be some retainment that will be useful. For sure using flexbox will involve a lot less guesswork.</p>
                
                <p>I also got some more good practice with React logic and rendering logic. I like that Josh and I came about the results in different ways. I like seeing the different ways. I do feel Josh’s ways are better and I spent some time diving into why they work the way they work, without getting too distracted as I am now at the allotted time for this course for today.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Learning more about objects and how to access them. Much review.</p>
                
                <p>Set up the Tic Tac Toe project so it will now fill in a symbol in the grid and then switch the player after each click (so there is a ghetto state check). I added functionality to ensure that once a tile is filled in it will not change the symbol.</p>
                
                <p>The last thing to figure out for this little tester project would be to check for the win.</p>
                
                <p>However we moved on in the course and have started a JavaScript quiz project. I got the basic HTML and CSS set up and then created a test question array with some JavaScript. Very basic functionality so far, but good progress!</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JS Devs</h3>
                <p>Okay, so to start this day I decided to figure out that issue I was having yesterday and did so. Now the items on the page display the “sale” or “new release” tags and are colored accordingly. This was very satisfying. Doing this also reinforced further my understanding of React and styled components.</p>
                
                <p>Next thing was to watch the solution videos, which was another way to not only reinforce what I just did, but learn other ways to do the same thing.</p>
                
                <p>Also, as a side, through these workshops and Frontend Mentor I am becoming much more familiar with utilizing Figma to make design decisions. However, I mostly do this when I have the basic thing working. Figma is there for the easy details like font size and padding, etc.</p>
                
                <p>Went through 2 of the solution videos and these were helpful. These alter and adjust the way I think and ultimately helped me to simplify my code.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                
                <p>New development in understanding of expressions versus statements. The example that helped this is the array methods .push and .concat.</p>
                
                <p>Array.push() is a statement when it comes to the array the value is being pushed to. The JavaScript instructs the original array to change/mutate by adding the argument to the end of the array. </p>
                
                <p>Array.push() is also an expression. The question it implicitly answers is the length of the array after the push has been accomplished. </p>
                
                <p>Array.concat() is not a statement. It is asking for the result of taking one array’s values and the values of a different array and gathering them together. The answer provided is a whole new array. The initial arrays are left intact, un-mutated. This doesn’t leave anything behind unless the answer is wired up to a variable.</p>
                
                <p>One takeaway: use immutable data when you can.</p>
                
                <p>————————————</p>
                
                <p>Moving on to the objects section. Again, I know this will be more review, but with familiarity, subtleties can be discerned… with the right vision. What is the right vision? The patient, curious, interested kind. So the practice here is to practice this.</p>
                
                <p>I like how the instructor called properties “pseudo-variables” - this is accurate. Properties are specialized variables that are only connected to objects, they are wires that only exist when connected to a value. </p>
                
                <p>I did spend a bit of time reviewing the Set and Spread operations and gained some further understanding of them. I learned that sets are special objects that do not have properties, but may have values untied to properties. This is useful for iterating through values of an object. Set objects also have their own special methods and properties. Similar to Map objects. Cool!</p>
                
                <p>And with that I am done with today’s learnings on this. </p>
                
                <h3>Building: Church Name Generator</h3>
                <p>Spending time learning about RapidAPI website.</p>
                
                <p>Created a simple system of gathering words from a database (made my own database for now) and how to filter out just the words. This is going to be a piece by piece project. </p>
                
                <p>The biggest thing is to think about how to start small and go from there. What are the basic functions that need to be done.</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JS Devs</h3>
                <p>Got the basics of the challenge figured out. Spent most of the time just looking through the file structure, working out how things work out in regards to React components and the styled components and how variables are being passed to determine states. </p>
                
                <p>Ended the time on time, made notes so I can pick up tomorrow where I left off today. There was a temptation to get overwhelmed about how much I already forgot in regards to how React and styled components works, but this was an opportunity to practice breathing into this and focusing on what needs to be focused on, i.e. not getting distracted.</p>
                
                <p>Tomorrow I will be able to watch the solution video and I know I will learn a lot.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Today was a lot more review, which was nice. Went over operators. Realized that operators are the verbs of expressions and statements. Went over various types of operators. </p>
                
                <p>This also led to a subtle gaining of understanding in the difference between expressions and statements. Operators are used in both, but there are operators that are used to express a value (conditionals for example), but other operators are used to tell Javascript to do something (assignment operator for example). </p>
                
                <p>We also started going over arrays which so far has been more review.</p>
                
                <p>One bonus of going over this is I am refining my JavaScript notes. I am removing unnecessary/incorrect/inaccurate information, and reorganizing to make the notes more helpful.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: Name Generator</h3>
                <p>My brother-in-law has a project. He wants to create a church name generator. I want to help him do this so I spent some time brainstorming the pseudo tasks of what an app like this would accomplish. </p>
                
                <p>I spent some time asking what the heck this thing will need to do, what the minimum viable product is?</p>
                
                <p>It’s easy to get bogged into the specifics. In the beginning the specifics is helpful to lead out to the general. From the general we can then come up with the proper pseudo actions at a broader, more abstract, yet more easily graspable layer. These actions are more straightforward and then we can get more specific from them. At least that’s my current thoughts.</p>
                
                <p>I have lots of questions about how to even get started on this. I am sort of winging it, but also doing my best to take advantage of work that has already been done. </p>
                
                <p>I know that APIs are going to play a big part.</p>
                
                <p>I found a couple APIs that I want to start building a MVP with. This product will have nothing to do with church names necessarily, just a way to efficiently gather words (WordsAPI) and then bring those words together in unique ways that make sense (unique-name-generator npm package).</p>
                
                <p>A bit overwhelmed simply because this will involve some backtracking in my knowledge and learnings. However I know that that overwhelm is just a lie. It’s not a problem. It’s the nature of the game. I have resources that I will be able to look back on and I have previous experience to draw upon. </p>

                <p>Holidays…. They get weird. They get “in the way,” but not necessarily in a bad way.  The last two days have been distracted by things, yet I would still find myself thinking about what I learned the last couple days about flexbox. I’d think about how hypothetical size and minimum content size relate to flex-shrink, flex-grow, flex-wrap. I feel that despite me not putting fingers on keyboard with codeful intent, there was still learning happening. But back to it.</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JS Devs</h3>
                <p>Today I start the challenge for module 3. This will be a Create React App app, but with just a focus on flexbox related layouts. The project is a mock store. I am excited.</p>
                
                <p>Today consisted a bit of re-familiarizing myself with React and Styled Components. Didn’t take too long.</p>
                
                <p>Next, I started reading through the project files and structure to see what I need to do.</p>
                
                <p>I focused on the header today and made some good progress, though there were some tricky problems that I solved, but am looking forward to seeing some solutions. </p>
                
                <p>I did get caught in doing things that weren’t related to the challenge itself, which I found out after watching the intro video, which I did not do at first (hopefully a lesson has been learned here).</p>
                
                <p>I could have continued on with this, but I am leaving off with this today and moving on with the next phase of today’s coding.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Frontend Masters Course</h3>
                <p>Signed up for the service, then picked the first class to start with.</p>
                
                <p><a href="https://frontendmasters.com/learn/javascript/" target="_blank">This is the program that I will be following to learn JavaScript mo betta</a></p>
                
                <p>The first task was setting up a repository to use for any projects that come up and link this with a remote repo. A lot of set up work. </p>
                
                <p>The next step is deciding where to start. The very first course starts from the beginning of JavaScript. This makes me feel a bit impatient at first, but if I can set this aside I know it will be valuable even if I feel I “already know this stuff”.</p>
                
                <p>This is the first course I will be starting with: <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-first-steps/" target="_blank">JavaScript: From First Steps to Professional</a></p>
                
                <p>I did not start from the beginning. I started from the section on the Document Object Model.</p>
                
                <p>Today’s lesson was a lot of review, but in a good way. Familiarity is growing immensely with DOM methods and properties. </p>
                
                <p>The bigger practice is simply bypassing the “know it already” attitude and learning to cultivate the “Beginner’s Mind.”</p>
                
                <p>The lesson was based on a simple Tic Tac Toe HTML page without any game functionality, so I did take a few minutes to build that out as well, which was also just good practice.</p>
                
                <p>The next section was more review. Having just went through the course Just JavaScript I feel extremely comfortable with this. I decided that while she discusses this I would review my own knowledge of values.</p>
                
                <p>There are two main kinds of values: primitive values and objects. </p>
                
                <p>Primitive values are not created by JavaScript; these exist outside the code.</p>
                
                <p>Objects are values that must be created. Functions are special kinds of objects.</p>
                
                <p>There are 7 primitive value types: null, undefined, boolean, strings, numbers, BigInts, symbols. </p>
                
                <p>Now with Numbers there are four special numbers: NaN,  -0, Infinity and -Infinity.</p>
                
                <p>For today, I ended after going over strings and how these work. I am grateful for the Just JavaScript course I took a month ago as it is supplementing and strengthening my understanding of JS values. </p>

                <p>Took a couple days off for Thanksgiving break, however I put together a game plan for moving forward that I am excited about.</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Learned a new awesome feature about flexbox that I did not know about. The feature involves the use of the margin property with the auto value. This allows items to behave similar to if one were to use justify-content: space-between, except without having to add unnecessary markup to group items together. This is very cool!</p>
                
                <p>I also created a nice reference project for an easy flex form.</p>
                
                <p>More exploring with setting up a form and other layouts that work with combining layout algorithms. There were challenges that made my head scratch and made me joyful to solve them and then learn a whole other way to solve the same problem when watching the solution. </p>
                
                <p>Created reference projects of both challenges. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Spending some more time becoming familiar with these hidden concepts that make up the functionality of the beloved flexbox.</p>
                
                <p>First there’s the axes: main and cross. The main axis is the axis where stuff gets applied. By ‘stuff’ I mean flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis… all these work in the main axis direction. </p>
                
                <p>I also found it interesting that there is no justify-content: stretch. Align-items property has the default value of ‘stretch’. Align-items always deals with the cross axis, never the main axis, which is justify-content’s axis. It makes sense that there is no ‘stretch’ value for the main axis because it is along the main axis that we generally want to have things set next to each other or stack, depending on the flex-direction. Just thought that was interesting.</p>
                
                <p>The sizes: there’s the hypothetical size, which is the natural size the element would be and then there’s the minimum-content size. The landscape that exists between the hypothetical size and the minimum-content size is the realm of flex-shrink. </p>
                
                <p>The landscape between the available unused space and the hypothetical space is the realm of flex-grow. </p>
                
                <p>Without specifying widths (or heights depending on the flex-direction; we will assume the default row direction for now), the minimum width any flex-child can be is the minimum-content width, which is the width of the padding plus the width of the longest word. </p>
                
                <p>Setting a width comes in 3 flavors: minimum, static, maximum. Setting a minimum-width will overwrite flex’s minimum-content limitation to be that value. Essentially any minimum-width value set will become the minimum-content width in terms of how flex-shrink works. </p>
                
                <p>Setting a max-width is capping the width that the flex-child can grow. It will grow up to that size. That is straight forward.</p>
                
                <p>Setting a static width sets the hypothetical size. Statically sized elements can still grow if given the value, and they can also shrink. </p>
                
                <p>Flex-basis will always win over width/height. No matter where the width declarations are made in the cascade. Flex-basis sets the hypothetical size.</p>
                
                <p>When flex-grow is applied evenly, the distribution of space for the elements will depend on the hypothetical space. If element A is 100px wider than element B, when both elements grow to fill the space, the difference in width between the two will still be 100px. They will both be wider, but the difference in the hypothetical width will be retained.</p>
                
                <p>Flex-wrap comes into play as soon as the hypothetical size limit is reached. </p>

                <p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
                
                <p>Note for yesterday: yesterday I spend some time looking into <a href="https://christopheraue.net/design/vertical-align#centering-an-icon" target="_blank">how the vertical alignment declaration works</a> and I found a helpful article that I will be using in the future. </p>
                
                <p>This morning I have been learning more about the subtleties of how flexbox works. I feel I have learned quite a lot so far.</p>
                
                <p>What I have learned is first that there are two sizes to know about. There’s the minimum-content size and there’s the hypothetical size.</p>
                
                <p>The minimum-content size is essentially the minimum size a flex-child will shrink to no matter what. This is the width of the longest word, plus whatever inline padding is applied. </p>
                
                <p>The hypothetical size is the size the element would naturally be. The text is not wrapped and the padding is applied. </p>
                
                <p>Flex-shrink and flex-grow are properties that deal with either side of the hypothetical size of the element.</p>
                
                <p>The easiest to understand for me is flex-grow. We have a flex-child that naturally takes up so much space, and in the main axis direction there is so much space left over. Flex-grow deals with this leftover space and tells the element how much of that leftover space it can take up. The value of the property determines what proportion of that available space is taken up. </p>
                
                <p>Flex-shrink is different. First, if a flex-child only has one word, then flex-shrink will do nothing because technically that element is already at its minimum-content size. Or, to put it another way, its minimum-content size and its hypothetical size are equal. </p>
                
                <p>If a flex-child has two words, then the flex-shrink distance comes into play the moment that second word wraps to the next line. Now there’s a difference between the hypothetical size and the minimum-content size. The distance that flex-shrink applies to equates to the difference between the current size of the flex-child element and the minimum-content size. </p>
                
                <p>The flex-shrink value and shrink rate has nothing to do with the rate at which an element goes from its flex-grown size to its hypothetical size. It only applies to the difference between hypothetical size and the minimum-content size. As soon as the hypothetical size is breached, then flex-shrink comes into play.</p>

                    <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                    <p>Jumping back into Josh’s course. For now the plan is to spend at least an hour everyday on the course. Currently I am in module 3 which is about the basics of flexbox.</p>
                    
                    <p>I already am pretty familiar with flexbox so this module should go by quickly, however when I am already familiar with the main content, it is a perfect opportunity to become aware of more subtle concepts. So I will keep my eyes peeled. Plus, practice is practice. </p>
                    
                    <p>————————————</p>
                    
                    <p>Just had a discovery about how align-contents works. This has been a bit vague to me, mainly due to it not being relevant. However today I discovered one area where it comes into play.</p>
                    
                    <p>Usually a flex container’s height will be set based on its content. However if a flex container has a specific height set and the flex-direction is row with wrapping enabled, when the wrap becomes active, each flex child will fill out the space specified (we’re assuming no overflow happening). </p>
                    
                    <p>This specified space is the flex-child containment area, however, the actual element living within this containment, doesn’t necessarily have to fill this space. By default align-items is set to stretch, and so in the cross-axis the element is set to stretch the cross space of the containment. </p>
                    
                    <p>Changing align-items to say flex-start will make the element within the containment its natural size in the cross direction, and then move the element to the start of the containment cell itself. </p>
                    
                    <p>The key here is the containment cell in the cross direction is always taking up the full allotted space, which is determined by factors such as the height of the flex container and the content of the flex-children. It is the area within which the element can be placed.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now to change how the containment itself is laid out, we use align-content. Its default value is stretch. If we change this to flex-start, what this does is shrink down the containment to the size of the element itself, and moves them to the cross-axis start of the flex container. In a way, what this does is alters the flex-child containment size. </p>
                    
                    <p>When the flex-child containment size is no longer stretching, now align-items isn’t effective. </p>
                    
                    <p>Align-content shrinks the flex-child containments, which means that these containments can be moved within the flex-parent’s containment area. </p>
                    
                    <p>Align-content isn’t very useful if height is not specified on the flex-parent (assuming flex-direction being row).</p>
                    
                    <p>————————————</p>
                    <p>Another thing I learned: there is no justify-content: stretch. In order to have a flex-child stretch to fill in a horizontal direction is to switch the flex-direction altogether. Stretching only occur in the cross-axis direction, not the main axis. Good to know!</p>
                    
                    <p>————————————</p>
                    <p>Understanding Vertical-Align:</p>
                    <p>This declaration and its values still tend to confuse me, but I spent a little time today and I think I understand it more. Maybe.</p>
                    
                    <p>The variables:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>inline or inline-block items
                        </li>
                        <li>font-size of elements
                        </li>
                        <li>line-height
                        </li>
                        <li>baseline
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>With no line-height set, it will be set by the font-size and all inline elements will align on the baseline. </p>
                    
                    <p>The height of the containing block of all the inline elements (not necessarily the container, but the pseudo-inline container is determined by the height of the element with the largest font-size.</p>
                    
                    <p>This declaration is all about how the baseline of one inline elements relates to the baseline of others.</p>
                    
                    <p>How it works I am still a bit confused. Will continue with <a href="https://christopheraue.net/design/vertical-align" target="_blank">this article on how vertical-alignment works</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>I still get caught using “center” instead of “middle” with this damn declaration. </p>

                <h3>Organizing</h3>
                <p>Since I have completed the Space Tourism site I am now ready to retire my old 2011 MacBook Pro. I have this fancy new MBP that has patiently been waiting for its time in the sunshine.</p>
                
                <p>Today involves a lot of organizing and setting up. I made sure that I had everything I needed from the old Mac and made a list of what I need to do to get my new Mac ready.</p>
                
                <p>This mainly meant making a list of the important apps to install and the repos to clone in to the local machine. Alfred is the only app I really needed to download. It is a life saver. When other needs come up, that is when I will download those. </p>
                
                <p>I also took this time to revisit my current trajectory. These between project gaps can be dangerous. They are where momentum can die. Hence the planning.</p>
                
                <p>At this point I am ready to move on with Josh’s CSS course. I also have another, simpler, Front End Mentor project that I want to start, as well as a React Bootcamp course and to start on a Javascript course in Front End Masters. Now it is just a matter of scheduling this out.</p>

                <p>Today is about finishing touches. Getting into the nitty gritty details.</p>
                
                <p>Already I made some adjustments to the grid layout of the crew page as I noticed things were a bit smooshed together. </p>
                
                <p>I used the Inspector to fine tune the grid and then set up more specified grid-template-column values to make it look much better. </p>
                
                <p>Also, solving small issues. Had to add color declaration to the large button because on my phone in Safari the color of the text was blue for some reason. </p>
                
                <p>Set up the Explore button functionality on the home page. I am not sure why this is made to be a button instead of just being a link because that is all it is. </p>
                
                <p>I added some visually hidden labels to the number indicators on the technology page. This initially broke the javascript, but I solved that easily enough. </p>
                
                <p>Watching some of the tutorial Kevin talked about progressively enhancing images by using the picture and the source element. This was cool as I hard coded in to use webp formatted images, but noticed on my older version of Safari that these weren’t showing up. Kevin’s talk solved this issue.</p>
                
                <p>I did have to go back through the javascript and update that so it dynamically loads the correct image into the correct place, but that wasn’t difficult at all. </p>
                
                <p>Next thing was to add alt attributes for all images and for this to update based on the image loaded. Again, this was simple. Had to update the object with the data, then set the attribute. Involved a few lines of code.</p>
                
                <p>Wrapped up the README for the project as well. I feel like I am ready to add it to the Front End mentor as complete to see what kinds of issues come up. </p>
                
                <p>Also, I checked on multiple devices and browsers and things seem to be working well.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>One of the things about learning something new, grid in this case, is the lack of consistency in implementation. This is par for the course. With less experience one is still finding methodologies and efficient patterns of operations. </p>
                
                <p>This website displays this. However, not that I am almost through with it I am finding that I would like more consistency throughout, especially with the components that are consistent throughout.</p>
                
                <p>What this means is I am going to rework the grid for the 2nd through 4th pages to make the page title and grid system more consistent.</p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                
                <p>Updating the grid system went easily enough. Now the page titles are consistent and the code itself is also more consistent.</p>
                
                <p>The next, and “last” thing to do is to set up the dynamic loading of content for the technology page.</p>
                
                <p>This is less straightforward than the other two in one way: there are two orientations for the images based on the viewport width. In desktop mode the image is to be in the portrait orientation. In all others it is to be landscape. </p>
                
                <p>I know what I am going to use to help me with this. It is the Media Query List API that I used for the smart focusing. I will use this to help me determine when to change the image out.</p>
                
                <p>The page loads initially with the landscape. That’s what’s in the initial HTML. When the script runs initially it will check to see if it is desktop mode, and if so it will perform the ol’ switcharoo on the image. </p>
                
                <p>Next I need to set up a listener so that images will be changed based on the media query. To do this I first had to check which button/tab is the active tab, which will allow me to select for the correct image. Then whenever the media query changes it will set the appropriate image.</p>
                
                <p>The last part is simply setting up the click listener for the tabs. I took advantage of the function I wrote for the media query event listener function and just ran that again based on the button selection. </p>
                
                <p>With this in place, everything is now working! Well… except the main Explore button on the first page. This button seems a little tricky in that it is really a link, not a button. It leads to the Destinations page. I am curious to see how to make this function on the backend with JavaScript. </p>
                
                <h3 id="Building: Fluid Type Calculator">Building: Fluid Type Calculator</h3>
                <p>I decided to whip up a quick and functional Fluid Type calculator, improving upon what I made yesterday by adding the html and some simple styling. It works and it did not take too long to put together. I am sure there are calculators out there already that I could have found, but damnit I like mine. </p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>

                <p>Well today went by pretty fast. Getting much quicker in decision making and the process itself is just moving faster. This is because I don’t have to think about as much for each of the next pages. It’s a cool momentum.</p>
                
                <p>I do believe that it is only by gaining enough of this kind of momentum that the more subtler and more exciting patterns start to emerge as far as seeing consistencies and getting a better feel for when something can be done more efficiently even if the how to do so isn’t there yet. Just that sense is a good thing.</p>
                
                <p>I got the last page of the site built up. It’s funny because when I started this project I was feeling such an overwhelm, but now it seems so straightforward on what to do and how to do. I am actually quite amazed at how much I did learn while putting this together. Seeing the mountain, feeling intimidated by it, taking it step by step and here I am damn near on the other side. </p>
                
                <p>Today’s challenge had to do with getting more familiar with grid and how it works and how I am really starting to like it. I like grid-template-areas and how they work.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Hitting a bit of a rhythm here. The crew page which is designed a bit differently got put together today.</p>
                
                <p>I implement grid-template areas to style the desktop version as I really like how that worked when watching Kevin’s tutorial.</p>
                
                <p>I implemented the JS dynamic loading of content similar to what I did on destinations page. </p>
                
                <p>I did run into a bit of a puzzle regarding this, which I mentioned last night. I solved the problem by simply putting all the text in the h2 element into spans that way I could grab them separately using data-element attributes and add the content.</p>
                
                <p>The next challenge was simply getting the image to sit the way the design has it and fix certain issues that occur at the edge case of the smallest desktop size. I implemented the clamp values and my handy clamp value calculator to create smoothly resizing type that fits and fills the screen nicely. </p>
                
                <p>Got started on the Technology page.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>I rebuilt the destinations page following Kevin’s tutorial. It went well. I am keeping the one I built, but I like how he implemented the grid template area property and will be doing that for the crew page.</p>
                
                <p>I made a good start on the crew mobile page. Started programming the dynamic filling script for the content. This was a little more challenging because there is a nested span in a header. </p>
                
                <p>The problem with this is setting the textContent to an element replaces everything within it. Also I do not want to use innerHTML if I don’t have to. What I found was the ability to create a textNode as well as an element and so with this I think I can make it work.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Yesterday I fixed up the focus styling for the tabs on the destinations page of the space tourism website. Thanks to the study I did 2 days ago I knew exactly what I had to do. No guesswork.</p>
                
                <p>Today I will get the destinations page functional for across all sizes.</p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                
                <p>The first issue I ran into was text overflowing the provided grid size at the minimum point for the desktop view.</p>
                
                <p>To solve this I first had to determine why the text was overflowing. This was layered. The first layer involves the allotted container space. The size of the width of the content columns is the viewport width - (the size of the padding + the minimum size of the first and last columns + the 3 gap sizes), all divided by two. </p>
                
                <p>Calculating this wasn’t necessary per say, but helped to pinpoint why the content columns were fixed at the size they were fixed at.</p>
                
                <p>Next I had to find what element within the overflowing column was causing the overflow. I used Dev Tools for this and found it had to do with the inner-column header as well as the tab gap sizes. </p>
                
                <p>I decided to solve this I would use the CSS clamp function.</p>
                
                <p>In order to use the clamp functioning precisely required me to identify first what values I would be clamping (gap size and header size), then identify the minimum font size and gap size at the desktop breakpoint that reduce/eliminate the overflow.</p>
                
                <p>For the header’s minimum font size I went to the header that was the longest then started reducing the font size in the inspector until it was below the width of the grid column. I then adjusted the gap size similarly.</p>
                
                <p>The initial sizes set by the design spec were to be the max font and gap sizes. </p>
                
                <p>Next I found the minimum viewport width size needed for the initial overflow to fit properly. </p>
                
                <p>With all these values I was able to calculate the clamp value needed. </p>
                
                <p>Awhile I ago I spent some time going through this article on how the clamp function works and how to get the correct values necessary. I was glad I created a note summarizing the formulas because I didn’t want to read it again. </p>
                
                <p>Because the formulas are a bit involved I decided to create the start of another reference project that would help me get the correct clamp value to copy and paste into my CSS.</p>
                
                <p>This evolved into creating a simple JS function that took in the necessary inputs and outputted the clamp value. I also coded in the option to have the output be in pixels or rems. The output is the full clamp string that can be copied and pasted as a value in the stylesheet. In the future I will make this into a legitimate tool. For now it is just JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>——————————</p>
                <p>The styling for the Destinations page is completed. I am debating whether I will watch Kevin’s tutorial for this or not. </p>

                <p>Phase two of yesterday’s goals commences today: The link and focus styling analysis.</p>
                
                <p>What I learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>:focus styling a link requires it being in the right order of the other link pseudo-classes.
                        LVFHA. A nice mnemonic for this: LoVe Fears HAte (it’s so precious)
                    </li>
                    <li>If :focus is styled, but no outline declaration is specified within the rule, then the default
                        styling supplied by the browser will be applied in addition to the styles declarations within
                        the rule.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the :focus pseudo class is used, then it will behave a bit differently than the default
                        browser focus styling for links and buttons. The default styling doesn’t style buttons and links
                        that are clicked on with the mouse. The styling only applies to items focused on via the
                        keyboard. With :focus, this changes. The :focus styling will apply to clicked buttons and links
                        and will remain that way until the page is clicked elsewhere. This may not be desirable
                        behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>Styling using :focus-visible seems to behave like the default styling in that the styling will
                        only be applied when the item is focused on via keyboard commands. The styling remains even when
                        the focused on item is click or entered.
                    </li>
                    <li>The ordering of :focus and :focus-visible matters. It works with the cascade. Later styles will
                        overwrite earlier ones.
                    </li>
                    <li>The :active link pseudo class is a momentary styling and is not useful for indicating a
                        currently selected tab.
                    </li>
                    <li>The :target class is pretty neat in that it is a way to style popups and tooltips.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>With all this mind it is time to apply these learnings to the Space Tourism site.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Starting to feel that this project is dragging a bit. Yet, I feel I have learned a lot in that dragging. A lot has been captured in the dragnet, so to speak. I’ve learned a lot about accessibility and focusability. I learned a lot about JavaScript and its APIs like Proxy Objects, Custom Elements, Media Query Lists, as well as classes and objects.</p>
                
                <p>I also learned that building design systems isn’t helpful until one has a certain vocabulary of building without them. This Space Tourism website has shown me what I already knew: following tutorials is not a good way to learn in general, but is nice for gathering tricks from more those more experienced. </p>
                
                <p>I have a couple goals for today: learn more about the difference between the focus and focus-visible pseudo classes as well as those of links and how all of these are related to one another. The other goal is to get the rest of the Javascript working to dynamically fill the destinations page. If I accomplish both of those goals, then this destinations page will be completed and there will only be two more pages left.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Phase One complete (which is actually goal 2 of the above paragraph… typical). The JavaScript is functioning and filling in the appropriate information. I remember when this was more difficult, but now certain things seem so much more obvious. With that said, giggles of joy arose with each correctly functioning button press. I am the rat and these buttons are releasing chemicals of pleasure. Press, press, press, press, press.</p>
                
                <p>The whole process is “simply” this: collect the information needed within JS objects, then collect each of the objects within an array. Arrays are nice because they have all those fancy methods and are easier to iterate through. Or at least that’s my thoughts at the moment. Already feeling second guesses at such a statement. But we will continue on.</p>
                
                <p>Next up, gather the button elements that will be needed. These buttons are the triggers. These triggers will initiate the action of updating the information on the page with that collected in the destination objects. </p>
                
                <p>With these collected it is time to add the event listener to each of the buttons. At this point I realize it would be nice to have a check to make sure that the button that is clicked is not associated with the information already loaded/displayed on the page itself.</p>
                
                <p>To do this I created (I realize I am bouncing around in tense, for that I apologize) a variable wired up to the first button element in the collection of the buttons I gathered earlier. I wired it up to the first simply because this is the initial information that the page will load with. </p>
                
                <p>With that done I set up a simple check to make sure that the button clicked is not the currently selected destination. If it is, well, click away my fine fellow, but nothing will happen. The action wired up to the click will simply return. However, if it is in fact different, then that’s when the fun begins. Oh yes. </p>
                
                <p>The first thing that is done is a state change. This occurs by updating the value of the aria-selected attributes of the selected destination and the, what is now, previously selected destination. This will update the styles accordingly.</p>
                
                <p>With that done, the correct destinations object is filtered out of the destinations array. This is done by grabbing the text content of the button itself which is the name of the destination. </p>
                
                <p>Next, each of the elements that need updating (title, summary, and stats) is wired up to a variable, then updated based on the values of the properties of the destination object. It is that easy.</p>
                
                <p>I love that I can now say that it is that easy. However, I know that that there is still a whole lot to learn (understatement) and I am sure the process I have implemented can be greatly improved upon with more experience. I am not cocky. Just grateful for progress and, more so, for the revelation of it.</p>
                
                <p>Phase Two will have to wait until tomorrow.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Last night was a brutal night of no sleep. Energy was extremely low today. Eventually I set myself in front of the computer. The hardest part is pushing through the borderlands of inertia. Once I get going then going becomes easier.</p>
                
                <p>I managed to get the destinations page styled up pretty quickly and easily, though I feel the CSS is a bit messy. I would like to rebuild this site again from the ground up and see if I can make it more orderly. With that said things are working and it looks good.</p>
                
                <p>I am not going to have individual pages for the 4 destinations, but am setting it up so the content changes based on the button that is clicked. I set up the “hard” part in the JavaScript file. I created an array of the objects with the necessary data to be loaded in.</p>
                
                <p>Upon clicking one of the destination tab buttons, there is a check against the initial destination that was loaded on the page. If the destination is different then the aria-selected attribute is updated, which updates the styling of the tab.</p>
                
                <p>The appropriate destination object is wired up to a variable. Next all I have to do is simply update the text content of the title, summary, and stats. Easy peasy. </p>

                <p>I created a new focus management system. This may not be as efficient as Andy Bell’s, but I am happy with it. It presented me with a challenge that I was able to solve. I tested it thoroughly and it is currently working quite nicely.</p>
                
                <p>Creating this made me think more about actions and triggers more deeply and how those are related to state and how state is what informs what specific action need to take place. </p>
                
                <p>Along with this I spent some time thinking about the progression from pseudo-code to actual code by identifying the triggers and the related actions that need to occur based on the state. </p>
                
                <p>There is a logical flow to this. Writing out the pseudo code puts into basic terms what needs to be accomplished. Identifying the triggers that initiates the actions moves us closer to the code itself. </p>
                
                <p>Trigger —> check current state (if necessary) —> perform actions —> update state (if necessary)</p>
                
                <p>All actions on the internet can be abstracted out to the above flow. </p>

                <p>Moving ahead with watching the tutorial. Got to the point where Kevin goes over his solution to the decorative horizontal line. His solution is neat and I like it, but I am sticking with mine. </p>
                
                <p>How he got his to work is by using a pseudo-element, which is what I wanted to use. He also utilized the order property to set where the line sits. I’ve never encountered this property before so it served as a good introduction to it. </p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                <p>The home page is now finished. Took way longer than I wanted, but this also has to do with me learning about a number of things, burger menu creation by way of Andy Bell’s tutorial being the biggest. I am moving forward with what I created while following with Kevin’s tutorial, though I am adding an additional aspect that combines both Andy’s and Kevin’s approach. </p>
                
                <p>Right now the focusable items remain focusable no matter if the menu is open or closed. The behavior I want for this is for links within the burger menu to only be focusable when the links are visible. </p>
                
                <p>The behavior will be implemented by way of using the tabindex=-1 declaration. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>I discovered the the mediaWatch method on the window object. This takes in a a media query string to check for. If I am within a certain media query I can trigger the changes I need. I can also add a ‘change’ event listener.</p>
                
                <p>This is the next step in the game.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Continuing with the walk-through of the homepage. We (yes, I have a mouse in my pocket) are now at the burger menu. One thing about Kevin’s tutorials that I like and dislike is his encouragement to do stuff on my own first. </p>
                
                <p>What I don’t like about this is it seems like a cop out for him. It means he doesn’t have to do the work. Like “Hey do this yourself because its good for you” and behind the scenes is this justification for laziness on his part for not actually doing the work and showing us what he would do. This defeats the purpose of the tutorial. Sure cheaters will cheat and they only cheat themselves., but should the one’s who don’t cheat be punished? That seems ridiculous. To me. </p>
                
                <p>What I like is that it’s important to not simply follow tutorials, but work stuff out for one’s self. I get this. It is inherent within me. I do this automatically. This is why I get annoyed when he doesn’t do something and uses the excuse that it’s good for me. I know it’s good for me, but at this point I want to see what you would do because that would be good for me too damnit.</p>
                
                <p>With that said, I did code the burger menu up using Javascript and have it functioning in a. Way that is pleasing to me and it took, maybe 10 mins. Now I will watch how he did it and code along if I feel it is necessary.</p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                
                <p>I liked how he did it. He utilized data attributes. This made for simpler code ultimately. He challenged us to change the icon and set up the animation. I did this, then watched how he did it. </p>
                
                <p>Again, he utilized the aria-expanded attribute to change the background-image in CSS. I am not sure if there is an advantage to doing it this way, but I think I like it better.  </p>
                
                <p>There seems to be a sense of separation of concerns. The JavaScript updates the attributes based on state, then within the CSS data-attribute selectors are used to update the styles. It keeps styling within the styles sheet and keeps the updating of attributes which control the styling within the JS. I loik it. I loik it a lot.</p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                <p>Good progress in styling the homepage and making it responsive. My favorite part was solving a tricky design dilemma. This highlights the gap between designer and developer. It’s so easy to just place a design element like a line within a graphics program, yet when it comes time to actually implement it in code, it is not so easy.</p>
                
                <p>I enjoyed mulling over different ways to save this dilemma where a horizontal line was added between the logo and the navigation. Logo and navigation lived on either side of the viewport, but between these there is a horizontal line that only serves a stylistic purpose. </p>
                
                <p>At first it tied using a pseudo element because these are not part of the HTML markup and so don’t gum up the works for screen readers, but I just couldn’t get it working in a way that was reliable between different screen sizes. I needed the line to be anchored on the left and on the right, but in a way where it could grow and shrink.</p>
                
                <p>The solution that came to mind was adding a spacer div to the markup and then taking advantage of the display flex set on the header, then simply setting flex-grow to 1 on this spacer element. I then just gave it a height of 2 px with a background-color and set the inline margins so they worked appropriately. This worked awesomely. I have yet to see how Kevin solved this problem, but I am looking forward to it. I feel very pleased with my solution and it is a sort of marker for growth in skills and knowledge.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Since I completed the home page I decided to watch the tutorial up to where I am. </p>
                
                <p>I created a new branch and deleted everything that I had to start from scratch. </p>
                
                <p>Kevin used grid in order to structure the content, which was good for me as it has been awhile since I used grid. </p>
                
                <p>One strategy that Kevin mentioned really intrigues me and I want to explore further. He mentioned how he styles from mobile first, but he builds the HTML from the desktop version first. This makes sense as the HTML structure for the desktop version is generally more complicated and so setting this structure up beforehand can make it easier. </p>
                
                <p>Kevin made use of the min and max functions, which I encountered before, but haven’t used much, so this was good.</p>
                
                <p>I am feeling a bit tangled up in the CSS and I am not sure I like the whole initial design system that was created. Creating things outside the actual website can make things more tedious. I am appreciative of this experience though as it reveals the importance of balance. </p>
                
                <p>Most of the challenges Kevin presented I either already completed or was able to complete. </p>
                
                <p>Ended at the functionality of the Burger menu button. I am looking forward to going through this tomorrow to see how he does it. </p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Okay, it is finally time to start filling in the easy markup of the homepage, now that I have gotten the burger menu implemented and in a way that makes me feel proud. Good habits are being built. These good habits consist of the principles and mental models of progressive enhancement and accessibility. </p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                
                <p>I got the homepage styled easy enough, but then I encountered an issue where the navigation, when display, is underneath the main button in the body of the page. I can fix it easy enough by applying z-indexes to the navigation elements, however, I am not quite understanding what is happening, in regards to stacking contexts. A weakness has been revealed, so I am taking some time to understand what the heck is going on in order to make a more informed decision about how to tackle this. </p>
                
                <p>I solved this issue after committing to the fact that the body is going to be the parent of the absolutely positioned navigation panel. Therefore, anything that comes after the navigation panel that is positioned will lay on top of the navigation unless the stacking order is changed. </p>
                
                <p>In this case the main button itself is on the default stacking layer and is on top of the navigation due to the button coming after the navigation. I updated the z-index of the navigation to be 1, which required me to update the z-index of the button to 2. I will find out if this will cause issues later. For now, the homepage is complete.</p>

                <h3>Building: Rebuilding the Burger Menu and Applying It to the Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>The more I try to rebuild this thing from the scratch the more I reveal the aspects of the JS function I don’t understand. </p>
                
                <p>I have learned a lot about scope doing this. There are some places where a variable is wired up, but in other places a property is wired up using ‘this’ keyword. I realize that the places where a variable is used are those where the variable is only used within the scope of that specific method. When the property is created it is because this property will need to be accessed elsewhere and sometimes this is outside of the current method’s scope. </p>
                
                <p>I also learned about the ‘this’ keyword. There is a specific place where a variable is created that is wired up to ‘this’. Then within this same method (this is the constructor method), the proxy object is created. Within the handler of the proxy object a method that is defined on the main object is called using the variable tied to the main object. In this scope, the ‘this’ keyword is referencing the proxy object and not the main object which has the method that is needed to be called. By wiring up the main object to a variable it gives access to the required method.</p>
                
                <p>I am noticing that there is still too much gray/unknown/lack of clarity in my mind between the actions that need to be done on the front-end with the JS code behind the scenes. The code itself is really neat, but it serves a purpose, and I could memorize the code, but that would be pointless and a waste of time. Memorizing is generally a waste of time. What we need to remember is remembered due to utility. Establishing the connection between the code written and its purpose generates memorization as a byproduct. </p>
                
                <p>I believe that this idea reveals the purpose of pseudo-code.</p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                
                <p>I completed the burger-menu rebuild and then added the burger menu functionality and adapted styling to the Space Tourism website. The more I build it out, the more I understand. With that said it is time to move on. Perhaps I will build it again in a couple days. We shall see. Looking forward to progressing and finishing this Space Tourism site.</p>

                <h3>Building: Rebuilding the Burger Menu</h3>
                <p>The first phase of this day is rebuilding the burger menu from scratch and as best as I can from memory. </p>
                
                <p>While going along I have been writing about what I am doing to reinforce the purpose of each move. This is helping me better grasp all the layers that are occurring within this project.</p>
                
                <p>This project is so juicy because it consists of so many layers. There’s a lot of accessibility happening with aria attributes and focusability adjustment depending on state. There is the progressive enhancement aspect that allows for a great user experience even without JS enabled. This progressive enhancement also means that if JS is disabled, there isn’t unnecessary markup muddying up the experience. </p>
                
                <p>The more time I spend in the land of Andy Bell’s burger menu, the more I glean. I am being greedy here. I want to suck up every bit of knowledge I can. I realize that there is a threshold where the gains will start to diminish, but I am not there yet. </p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism</h3>
                <p>Alrighty! Back to the Space Tourism website. I am excited to apply what I learned over the last few days to building out the hamburger menu on this page. </p>
                
                <p>Okay, so I had to sort of relearn what the heck was happening in the Design System that was created. As I was coding the homepage I realized that some wackiness was happening within the CSS in regards to focus behavior.</p>
                
                <p>I am not pushing blame on anyone, but I found it interesting that while following along with Kevin he set focus behavior on a list item. I didn’t think anything of it while following along, but now, due to my burger menu adventure, I am much more familiar with focus behavior. This caused me to use the tab key and that’s when I discovered the problem. </p>
                
                <p>First, the styling was not working as expected. This was because the list item doesn’t get focused, the link gets focus. To make the list item have focus we would need to add the “tabindex=0” to the list item. However, what would be the point of doing that? That would add an unnecessary layer for keyboard users to get to the actual link! Not a good UI. </p>
                
                <p>So I went on another side adventure in styling up focus. I learned about using box-shadow. I learned about the potential issue of using border in that it causes things to shift around. I also learned that outline seems to now follow along with border-radius. I am not so sure if this is true, but my experiments show it to be.</p>
                
                <p>The next phase was applying what I learned to the CSS I already have implemented for the Space Tourism website. It wasn’t too difficult to do this. Just had to move a selector down (or up?) the rung. </p>
                
                <p>———————————</p>
                <p>With the basic styling in place it was time to start applying the fancy schmancy burger menu to this project. This was another opportunity to reinforce my learnings.</p>
                
                <p>I began by going off my memory. This was helpful in revealing the parts I still did not comprehend. I think I am going to do this many more times over the next few weeks. I believe many important concepts and patterns of thinking will be reinforced by doing so. </p>
                
                <p>I got the burger menu code coded up. The next phase is styling it up. I am excited to be implementing this feature into this project.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Burger Menu</h3>

                <h4>Summary of the Burger project and the JavaScript</h4>
                <p>Had a nice Sunday off yesterday. Days off are good. No coding was done, yet at the same time I know that some behind-the-scenes processing was taking place. </p>
                
                <p>Today I continue with this Burger Menu. I had no idea that it would turn out to be a multi-day side-adventure, but I already feel I know so much more about JavaScript and other specialized APIs such as Resize Observer, Custom Elements, and Proxy objects. I also have learned a lot about state and its use. This will definitely come handy when I start learning React. </p>
                
                <p>A sloppy summary of this Burger Menu:</p>
                
                <p>We have a button. The good ol’ burger button that we are all familiar with.  When the screen is at a certain size it appears and the navigation goes away, and vice versa.</p>
                
                <p>When the button is present, it has a basic functionality of revealing and concealing the navigation. </p>
                
                <p>These are the two visibility concerns. </p>
                
                <p>Then there is the case of focusability. When the button is not showing, we want links to be focusable as they naturally would be. When the button is showing and the menu is closed, we don’t want the links to be focusable. When it is open we do. </p>
                
                <p>These are the conditions that the Burger Menu JS works with. Another word for these conditions is “state”. </p>
                
                <p>Between the user interaction and the resulting changes in the HTML is a state-controlling object. There are two states that need to be controlled: “status” and “enabled”.</p>
                
                <p>The “status” state relates to whether or not the menu is open or closed. This state is only relevant when the button itself is visible.</p>
                
                <p>The “enabled” state relates to whether the button itself is visible. If it is visible, then the “status” state becomes relevant. If it is not visible, then the button is unclickable and so the “status” state is irrelevant.</p>
                
                <p>The initial loading of the page triggers the script to run and set the initial states. The window width will determine the visibility of the button. If the button is initially visible, the menu will be closed (“status” = ‘closed’).</p>
                
                <p>At this point the user can resize the window or click the button and it is these two actions that cause changes to the state object. The state object itself has a handler that will trigger changes in the HTML (attribute values and focusability).</p>
                
                <p>User interactions change the state object, which triggers changes in the HTML. The state object is like a controlling buffer. </p>
                
                <p>The state object is necessary for memory. In order for a thing to open, it must somehow know that it is closed. In order for a thing to be set to be focusable or not, it must know what its surroundings are like. The state object is what conveys this information.</p>
                
                <p>It’s extremely nifty.</p>
                
                <h4>Styling the Burger Menu</h4>
                <p>I completed the styling and there are some very cool things happening here.</p>
                
                <p>Here’s a link to the final project: <a href="https://chrissoncrant.github.io/reference-projects/hamburger-menu/" target="_blank">Hamburger Menu</a></p>
                
                <p>The intricacies of the CSS are definitely worth analyzing further, but not here… at least for now. </p>
                
                <p>A quick summary though:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigation menu is set to fill entire screen

                <h3>Learning: Andy Bell Tutorial on Global State System</h3>
                <p>I followed this <a href="https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-light-and-global-state-system/" target="_blank">Andy Bell tutorial on creating a global state system</a> which helped me grow even more familiar with the concept of state, how it works, and how Proxy object are very useful for doing do.</p>
                
                <p>I created a reference project for this, commenting it out to help with my current and future understanding of what the hell it is doing, and added it to my growing list of reference projects.</p>
                
                <p>I feel that I have learned so much practical JS over the course of analyzing the burger menu’s JS and this JS. I am looking forward to seeing how to implement it in the Space Tourism project, which I am about to get into next.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Burger Menu JavaScript</h3>
                <p>I am continuing analyzing the burger-menu JavaScript. I do this by commenting each method and each statement within the methods. </p>
                
                <p>I reorganized the class’ methods to better represent the flow. I am now so much more familiar with this class and how its pieces work.</p>
                
                <p>I am seeing now how cool custom elements are. The API for customElements gives access to the connectedCallback, which is called whenever the connected HTML custom element is added to the DOM. </p>
                
                <p>One thing that really helped in growing my understanding was taking a step back and examine what actions I want the code to take. Going back up to pseudo-code level.</p>
                
                <p>This is where I saw how the burger button’s visibility and the navigation was dependent up the width. I saw how in addition to this, once the button is visible the navigation’s visibility is controlled by the button clicks. </p>
                
                <p>That’s two actions there. The burger buttons visibility is related to the “enabled” attribute and the burger button’s ability to alter the visibility of the navigation is related to the “status” attribute.</p>
                
                <p>These attributes connect to CSS as well, as that’s where visibility will ultimately be altered. </p>
                
                <p>Behind the scenes there is an object that essentially keeps track of where everything is at was for incoming write operations to make the appropriate adjustments. This is the State object. </p>
                
                <p>When a user resizes or clicks the button, some JavaScript is triggered, which updates the State object, which triggers other functions to adjust certain behaviors and update certain HTML attribute values, which in turn alters what CSS is applied to the element. </p>
                
                <p>That’s basically what happens. But it’s quite a chunk of code that makes it happen.</p>
                
                <p>Speaking of CSS, I began playing around with the attributes and made some rules to define the button’s visibility and the menus visibility. </p>
                
                <p>I think tomorrow, or Monday I will be able to move forward from this awesome side adventure and start on the space-tourism website. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Proxy Objects</h3>
                <p>Continuing with he Hamburger Menu javascript function, I am led to Proxy objects. I had no idea what these were or how they worked. I now know much more, not only about these special objects, but also about what getters and setters are in general.</p>
                
                <p>Proxy objects are, to me, like secretary objects. They are a layer between the object and the outside world. Almost like how an API endpoint is between the data and the request being made. Proxy objects wrap the “target” object and any calls made to the proxy will go through the specified handler object. </p>
                
                <p>There are many methods that can be specified on the handler object. The most used are probably the getters and setters. Whenever a read request is made to the proxy object, they will be “intercepted” within the get “trap”. Whenever a write request is made on the proxy object these will be intercepted by the set trap. </p>
                
                <p><a href="https://javascript.info/proxy" target="_blank">This resource on proxy objects</a> was helpful for my understanding.</p>
                
                <p>I created a reference project for proxy objects as well.</p>
                
                <p>I limited my dive into this potential rabbit hole via how the Proxy element was being used within the Burger menu code. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Burger Menu JavaScript</h3>
                <p>With my newfound knowledge and began going through the huge custom element class and all of its methods, commenting out what each method and property is doing and how they are all tied together. This has been an enlightening experience. I feel like I have learned so very much. Form doing this. </p>
                
                <p>Based on my commenting I now know how the Resize Observer is being used and how it works. Instead of using media queries, this Resize Observer is determining whether or not to display the burger menu button based on the size of the <p> <code class='code-inline'>&lt;burger-menu&gt;</code> </p>custom element’s parent’s width when compared to the ‘max-width’ attribute’s value that is set on the burger-menu element. </p>

                <h3>Learning: JavaScript Classes</h3>
                <p>Today I thought I’d take apart that crazy class that was coded yesterday from  <a href="https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/" target="_blank">Andy Bell’s Hamburger Menu tutorial</a>. I started reading through the code noting what I needed to learn. This started off with classes in general.</p>
                
                <p>I started reading through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes" target="_blank">MDN’s article on JavaScript classes</a> while creating my own examples. This will end up being a reference project about classes. </p>
                
                <p>There is still quite a lot that goes over my head (binding, species, mix-ins), but that is simply par for the course. Without a real life need for it, there really is no need to worry about not quite “getting it.” Plus I know from experience, this brush with those concepts will make it easier to get once I encounter those things in the wild.</p>
                
                <p>I do now have a much better understanding of what the hell a class is (a special function which is essentially an object creator/factory that uses specialized sugary syntax that is a part of ES6, which improves upon the syntax needed to do the same thing with ES5), what a getter is and how it works, what extending a class does and what the super() function is.</p>
                
                <p>The next thing to explore is the Custom Elements and how they work in relation to extending them from the HTMLElement object, which is what is being done in the Hamburger Menu code. </p>
                
                <h2>Learning: Custom Elements</h2>
                <p>Dove into the MDN article on Custom Elements. Learned about how these work and how, for the most part, in order to take advantage of the built-in methods and properties of elements, these will want to be tied to the existing elements. This involves JavaScript and utilizing classes to extend the current objects, HTMLElement being the focus of my current circumstance.</p>
                
                <p>I created a little not for myself for a blog article to write about how to see the benefits of doing so. This article would highlight the usefulness of console.dir(), which displays all the properties of the object argument, both own and inherited. I did not know about console.dir() until I googled how to see inherited properties of an object.</p>
                
                <p>I also learned about how the lifecycle callbacks work and what they are for. Currently, the only one that is relevant is the connectedCallback(), as that’s what is used in the Hamburger Menu  in Andy Bell’s tutorial (link above). </p>
                
                <p>I also took a bit of a dive into what the Shadow DOM is as each of the articles I read which had to do with Custom Elements mentioned the Shadow Dom. It’s definitely a cool thing. Perhaps even as cool as it sounds… depends on who you talk to. Anything with “Shadow” appended to it instantly is cooler. For example: Shadow muffin. </p>
                
                <p>After today’s learnings the fancy JS from Andy’s tutorial is definitely making a whole lot more sense to me. I can actually read it quite clearly. Tomorrow I will begin looking into Proxy objects. I think it will take a bit more time for that concept to sink in, an</p>

                <h3>Learning: Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The goal is to start and finish the Space Tourism website project from Frontend Mentor. While starting on the home page I realized this was a really good opportunity to start applying some accessibility principles. </p>
                
                <p>I began today starting to read through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility" target="_blank">MDN’s What is Accessibility? article</a>. This was helpful because my understanding of who the audience of accessible website is for was foggy. Now I understand much more clearly the impairments accessible website are designed to work with.</p>
                
                <p>As a web developer, I want accessibility to be a fundamental priority and basis for how I work. I believe, strongly, that sites that are designed with accessibility in mind are not hamstrung by these limits, but are made more robust, functionally and even aesthetically. </p>
                
                <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility#element_relationships_and_context" target="_blank">This MDN article on handling common accessibility problems</a> was also an insightful read. It provided information on common pitfalls and how to correct them and also provided a lot of tools for testing accessibility. </p>
                
                <p>While reading these I also learned the context of WAI-ARIA attributes and what purpose they serve. Oftentimes as a web designer and developer the standard HTML elements that come with their own styling just won’t do. In these cases where custom components are needed, the same accessibility as would be provided by the semantic HTML element can be added using WAI-ARIA. This is cool!</p>
                
                <h2>Building: Space Tourism Site</h2>
                <p>I am going to finish up the hamburger menu tutorial from Andy Bell, which I started a few nights ago. Once I have this down I can code the hamburger menu of the home page as well as the rest of the home page. </p>
                
                <h2>Learning: Hamburger Menu Tutorial</h2>
                <p>Holy freakin’ smokes. Was cruising along with <a href="https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/" target="_blank">Andy Bell’s Hamburger Menu tutorial</a> and then I got to the JavaScript. This made y head explode a bit. But in a good way.</p>
                
                <p>He is using object orienting programming and constructed a class that has built within it several neat pieces of code using lots of things I am as of now unfamiliar with. </p>
                
                <p>The things: custom elements utilizing the Lifecycle callbacks, and extending them from the HTMLElement object, class syntax (though I do have a bit of experience with this), getters, Proxy objects, lots and lots of usage of the ‘this’ keyword, ResizeObserver API…</p>
                
                <p>There’s a lot going on. But I love how over my head this feels. It is meaty, juicy, good soil for lots of learning.</p>
                
                <p>Just writing out the code was a good practice. Every step of the way I was thinking about what this line was doing and how it related to the grand scheme. No mindless copying. </p>
                
                <p>Once I got it written, then, of course, it didn’t work right. But this was only another golden opportunity to troubleshoot. Dev Tools and console.log to the rescue. Troubleshooting this got me more familiar with the object and its intricacies. I solved the issue I was facing, but now I am faced with a new one that I am going to be saving for tomorrow to tackle. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>The calc() function is interesting. It was confusing to me at first how to apply units. For example if I wanted to convert 3px to rems I know I would divide 3 by 16, which give 0.1875 and I can apply ‘rems’ unit to that. But what if I wanted to use the calc function? How would I apply the rem units?</p>
                
                <p>Well, it would look like this: <code class='code-inline'>font-size: calc(3rem / 16);</code></p>
                
                <p>This would essentially give me 0.1875rems.</p>
                
                <p>But at a glance it can be confusing. What this calc function is not doing is first calculating what 3rems is and then dividing by 16, which would give 3rems as the result. What it is doing is calculating what 3 / 16 is, then applying the rem unit to the answer. </p>
                
                <p>This is a syntactical behavior of the calc function. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Finishing up the Icon Input challenge today. I have already created my own version of it using vanilla CSS. I am now watching the video to see how Josh did it, to see if there’s any tricks.</p>
                
                <p>After watching the video I completed the challenge, which was also the end of Module 3.</p>
                
                <p>Overall these three challenges (progress bar, select element, and input element styling) were great practice. I was able to create vanilla CSS component modules and classes that allowed me style selectively. Each of these challenges led me to create a reference project to add to my references project. </p>
                
                <p>I was able to translate the vanilla CSS to React and styled components. I learned about the tool Storybook and spent some extra time investigating how this was implemented within the project.</p>
                
                <p>I feel I now know so much more about React and styled components, even though this is not a course on either of those. I am glad about this because of my intention that existed prior to this course to learn about them. On top of that, my CSS skills have gained a great boost as well.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: Reference Project</h3>
                <p>I added the input styling and breadcrumbs projects to the reference project and added the appropriate links to the main page. </p>

                <h3>Building: Select Element Reference Project</h3>
                <p>Today I finalized a select element method for having a functional and custom designed element. This project is in relation to the 2nd challenge in Module 3 of CSS for JavaScript Developers course. </p>
                
                <p>I made notes on why each rule and declaration’s purpose is so when I reference it again it should be clear what the heck is going on. </p>
                
                <p>I added this to the reference project and updated this project by adding links to all the reference projects within. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>I then finished the 2nd challenge for the select element by applying the HTML and styles via styled components. </p>
                
                <p>I started the 3rd challenge where we are styling up an input that has an icon within it. This is a tricky challenge and I encountered the methodology before. It is a pattern that’s definitely “out there.”</p>
                
                <p>Before I get to the discussing this pattern, I just want to mention that how I have been doing the last two challenges is to code it up outside of React and styled components, then once I have it working with vanilla CSS and JavaScript (JS for the second challenge; not for the third) it is super easy to convert it into React components and style it with styled components and it helps with my understanding. </p>
                
                <p>Back to the pattern for these input elements: The pattern is to use the label element as the container. The icon is removed from flow using absolute positioning and then given space to exist using padding on the input. </p>
                
                <p>There is a trick here. When the padding is added to the input, this extends the input by that amount. So using width: 100% on the input element will not work as expected. It will break out of the label container by the amount of padding that was added. This is solved using the calc function on the input.</p>
                
                <p>Over the course of these challenges I have become much more familiar with the usefulness of relative units. What I have been doing is setting sizes with rem units on the parent and then using ems for all the descendants. This just makes a lot more sense to me and give me one source of control on the parent container. Or at least it seems to be the case. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Last night I made really good progress on the progress bar component. I took advantage of the progress HTML element. Once I got it looking good I started watching the solution video.</p>
                
                <p>Josh went with using a div and the proper aria role instead of using the progress HTML element. I actually like this approach for the simple fact that styling a progress element is not widely supported across browsers and bulky in terms of having to special pseudo-elements. And, even with the pseudo elements, these only work for Chrome and Safari and not Firefox. </p>
                
                <p>Awesomely, as soon as I started the solution video I paused it and started doing it all myself. It was cool seeing my chosen solutions being validated by the much more experienced Josh. This kind of validation is important at this stage in my developing web development skills. It is affirming.</p>
                
                <p>I completed the progress bar with great satisfaction.</p>
                
                <p>Started on the styling the select element challenge. Learned a very nifty way to style select elements by watching Josh’s tutorial. It separates the functionality provided by the select menu from the look of the select menu. Basically the select element sits on top of the styled portion as an invisible layer (basically the select element is set to 0 opacity). This allows us to easily style the select portion in a way that will be consistent across browsers. Clicking the element reveals the functionality provided by the select element. This is crafty and I like it a lot.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Even with box-sizing set to border-box, if width and height is not specified explicitly, it will behave the same as if box-sizing was set to content-box.</p>
                
                <p>This is interesting to me because so many people claim how much more useful border-box is versus content-box, yet it doesn’t seem very often that explicit width and height is specified, especially when one is making a website responsive. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Continuing with module 3. I watched the solution video to yesterday’s challenge. This was helpful. Of course he solved it in an entirely different way. This is one of the things I like about coding. There’s so many ways to do the same thing. </p>
                
                <p>I actually liked how I did it more versus how he did it, but I learned about a new functionality with styled components that I want to try in the future. Styled components allow for building on what are essentially base classes. This is similar to how classes in JavaScript can be extended. </p>
                
                <p>Today I learned about the importance of grouping contextual styles to prevent the hunting that can come with having styles for a component spread out. His solution is tied to styled components and uses what he calls inversion of control nesting, where the parent child section is nested within the child being styled.  This effectively groups all the contextual stylings with the item being contextually styled.</p>
                
                <p>Using vanilla CSS I see that this could be done, not with inversion of control nesting, as that isn’t possible within vanilla CSS, but through grouping contextually styled elements together. Instead of having the contextual style be grouped with the parent, they are grouped together based on the element being contextually styled. This creates an easy way to find and change/update styles, as well as see more clearly what all will be effected by a change. </p>
                
                <p>——————————————————————</p>
                
                <p>I’ve reached the workshop portion of module 3 and this one seems like it could be a doozy. Looks like I will be learning about a tool called Storybook, which is used for helping developers create components and quickly test them with different property values. </p>
                
                <p>It looks like a lot of folks have given feedback on this one as well about its difficulty. This actually excites me quite a bit. </p>
                
                <p>There are 3 components we are building: a progress bar, a Select component, and an Icon Input (I think this is for adding icons to an input. </p>
                
                <p>The first phase of this is going through the README and getting familiar with the project structure and files and with Storybook. </p>
                
                <p>It seems like all the actual visualizing will be occurring in Storybook which will be run via local host.</p>
                
                <p>I started on this workshop with the process bar challenge. The challenge itself started off with me looking up how these are applied using using MDN docs on ARIA roles.</p>
                
                <p>I then spent some time reading some articles on how to style the <progress> element, then I got started on the actual challenge.</p>
                
                <p>I feel like I have learned a lot about styled components and React. At last relatively speaking. I am sure there is SO much I have no clue about, but I know that I know much more today than I did yesterday. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Continuing with module 3. Getting more practice with styled components and React. </p>
                
                <p>Had to use the iPad and GoodNotes to write out my understanding on how certain properties were working.</p>
                
                <p>The React component has properties, which are the parameters of the function, but then styled components also has properties, which are specified on the actual component being styled. This layer of properties (the styled components properties) are accessed using interpolation functions, which basically utilizes the template literal ‘${}’ syntax.</p>
                
                <p>It took a bit of time and analysis to realize how these layers of properties work, then how to actually use them. The exercises I went through today helped me gain a better understanding of what the hell is going on.</p>
                
                <p>I definitely feel the mental stretching occurring here and I like the feeling. Is it a bit stressful? Yes and no. Mostly no. As for the ‘yes’ I would say the stress is positive. At least it is when I respond to it appropriately, which is to say I take my time and be sensitive to what parts I am not understanding. It is only when I disengage form the sensitivity that it becomes negatively stressful. Luckily I have a good amount of experience with this stress and I am getting better at responding to it appropriately. </p>
                
                <p>Today has definitely made me feel like the best way to learn the JavaScript I need to learn to learn React is to learn React. Learning must occur within context and the context of React is so JavaScript heavy that it makes for a great learning context. </p>

            <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
            <p>Starting on Module 3 today, which is about component architecture.</p>
            
            <p>A lot of this module is about using styled-components, which I have been wanting to get into, along with React.</p>
            
            <p>I am feeling myself a bit anxiety-ridden now. Should I start learning React right now, so I can start using style-components? Am I skilled enough in JavaScript to start learning React? I feel like the game plan has been a bit knocked off its track. </p>
            
            <p>I really like aspects of styled-components, such as not having to think of class names, which is not a very fun thing to do, even with methodologies like BEM or Cube CSS. </p>
            
            <p>I also really like what I’ve seen of React. I get excited thinking about React. I also know the job prospects for React are pretty large. </p>
            
            <p>For now, I have things to do.</p>
            
            <p>I spent some time writing out about styled components, which involved explaining to myself both the JSX syntax, as well as the syntax for styled-components, which uses tagged template literals. It’s different, but also pretty straightforward me thinks. </p>
            
            <h3>Building: Space Tourism site</h3>
            <p>Getting started on the actual site today. </p>
            
            <p>Well, actually I wrapped up the design system by writing a blurb about it in the project README file. </p>
            
            <p>To start on the homepage of the site is to start on the Burger Menu. To learn how to do this I am building out a reference project that is following <a href="https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/" target="_blank">Andy Bell’s tutorial on creating a progressively enhanced and fully responsive burger menu</a>. </p>
            
            <p>This tutorial is layered in its education. It is a practice in using BEM class naming (something that would be completely unnecessary with styled-components), as well as in accessibility and focus behavior. It is also teaching about progressive enhancement, which is a coding philosophy I can get behind for sure. </p>
            
            <p>Got all the way up to the JavaScript portion. Right now the site is minimally functional. If JavaScript weren’t working, or was disabled by the user, this site would still be perfectly usable for all users. That’s awesome.</p>
            
            <p>Tomorrow I begin to enhance the behavior of this menu. I am excited.</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for Developers</h3>

                <p>Completed the project for module 2, which was an interesting exercise.</p>
                
                <p>What made it most interesting was that it was a React application, which added a layer on top of exercising what I learned within the module. I am not so familiar with React yet. I have had a brief intro to it 4 months or so ago while taking a Node.js course. That bit of experience helped me with this.</p>
                
                <p>I really like React and how the projects are compartmentalized into components. I am looking forward to learning React soon.</p>
                
                <p>This exercise was all about practicing principles learned in Module 2. It was about utilizing positioning layout with absolute, relative and fixed positions. It also involved stacking context and overflow. </p>
                
                <p>I challenged myself by not engaging in z-index wars and really thinking in terms of the stacking contexts created and how the flow ordering impacts what gets laid on top of what. </p>
                
                <p>I was able to complete it and all the challenges without too much trouble. I even managed to complete the “stretch” challenge which was intended for more “advanced” students. It could have probably been done better, but it worked! I am looking forward to watching the review.</p>
                
                <p>Watched the review, learned better ways to size the fixed image by using percentages and using opposite value (top and bottom) to set height.</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Almost finished module 2. Went over how to hide things via <code class='code-inline'>display: none</code>, <code class='code-inline'>visibility: hidden</code>, and the opacity property.</p>
                
                <p>This section discussed the differences between these. The <code class='code-inline'>display: none</code> declaration removes an element completely from the DOM and it becomes truly inaccessible.</p>
                
                <p>The <code class='code-inline'>visibility: hidden</code> declaration makes the element invisible, but does not remove it from flow. Its box with all its box properties are still there. This can be useful for selectively revealing items, such as answers to questions. </p>
                
                <p>Interestingly, with this property one can set a parent element to be visibly hidden, and then selectively set children to be visible. </p>
                
                <p>This property also removes items from being clickable, selectable, and focusable.</p>
                
                <p>The last property, <code class='code-inline'>opacity</code>, works similarly to <code class='code-inline'>visibility: hidden</code> in that the element remains in flow. However, a key difference is that the element is still clickable, selectable and focusable which can create weird user experiences for people using screen readers.</p>
                
                <p>The most important section of this section, I think, is how to visually hide things for screen users, while keeping them “visible” for screen-reader users. This is important for items like buttons that only contain icons.</p>
                
                <p>There are many ways to do this. One method is to set the <code class='code-inline'>aria-label: “Button Label Here”</code> attribute, but this sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t depending on context. </p>
                
                <p>The method described by Josh involves a CSS utility class called ‘screen-reader-only’ or ‘sr-only’. What this does is it takes the element and moves it out of the way through clever declarations so it is not visible to screen users, yet will be ‘visible’ for screen reader users.</p>
                
                <p>I added this useful utility to my utilities.css template. </p>
                
                <p>I am leaving the project portion of this section for tomorrow as today is filled with non-coding related chores. I am now moving on to the Space Tourism website.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Website</h3>
                <p>Last time I left off by finishing up the Design System html file. I wills tart today by reviewing what I did, then watching the tutorial on this section and making adjustments if I feel it improves what I’ve already accomplished. After this it will be time to get started on the actual site!</p>
                
                <p>While watching the tutorial:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I changed the class name of the large button from ‘main-button’ to ‘large-button’. This makes
                        sense because it is less specific and so this component could be used elsewhere in the site in
                        the future if it is needed. ‘main-button’ is too specific as it implies only one, whereas
                        ‘large-button’ only indicates size, not importance.
                    </li>
                    <li>The other thing changed was the element itself. I changed it from a button to a link. I did this
                        because it is what Kevin did, however it led me to the question: When should I use a button and
                        when should I use a link? This led me to researching on the web and reading a few different
                        articles.
                        <ul>
                            <li> What I seen several times is that buttons should be used when a change is made to the
                                front or back-end and a link should be used when directing to a new page or section. But
                                isn’t a new page opening a change to the front-end?
                            </li>
                            <li> I read about how links should look like links, and not like buttons to work with the
                                expectations of users. However, this does not seem to be something that is followed very
                                often. For example, this link I am styling right now in this project.
                            </li>
                            <li> I read about how there is a difference when it comes to accessibility as well and I
                                think this is the more important thing to consider.
                            </li>
                            <li> For this project, I know that this ‘button’ will be leading to a page, so it is
                                definitely a link, not a button and therefore the markup should follow this. So it makes
                                sense to use a link tag.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Styling this link was another opportunity to play around with the balance between component
                        styling and using utility classes. The link component ‘large-button’ has certain dimensions, but
                        there are aspects of this component that could change in different sections. Things like the
                        background-color and the font-color and maybe even the font-family itself. The things that
                        change are great utility class use candidates.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Very happy to learn about a new way of creating a circular ‘button’ with centered text. This method utilizes vertical padding along with aspect-ration property. This creates the circle. To center the text I would usually utilize display:flex with justify-content and align-items set to center. But I really like this new (for me) way of using display:grid with place-items: center. This saves me a line of code. I like it. </p>
                
                <p>When it comes to creating the large border that shows up on hovering, there are several options. For sure I know I do not want the layout to change when this border appears. </p>
                
                <p>I thought that if I create the border I could just make its color be transparent/0% opacity and alter this upon hovering, but this didn’t work. What occurred is the background color was revealed. I did not realize setting a border extends the background to the outer edge of the border. I thought that the background-color would stay within the content box itself. I tried changing the box-sizing back  to content-box , but this didn’t work either. </p>
                
                <p>The next thing was to set the border to be the same color as the background itself. This works, however in the actual website it looks like a background-image is being used and so this border may be visible depending on the background-image, and this is not what I want either. </p>
                
                <p>The next thing is to use an outline. Outlines do not alter the layout. Using an outline means that I would want to add a margin to this button that is at least the width of the border so the outline does not clash with other content.</p>
                
                <p>After setting the move up using outline, I watched Kevin’s methodology. The way he went about it was by using the ::after pseudo element. This method was interesting and I did feel like I learned a bit more about how these work, however I feel this was an extremely complex way to go about it. </p>
                
                <p>I could accomplish the same thing with a whole lot less lines of code. I wish I could ask him why he chose the method he did versus using outline, especially given that when he set the :hover pseudo class he also defined the :focus pseudo class along with it, which is setting the outline behavior. </p>

                <p>Today is Sunday. For the most part this is a day off for me. With that said I did makes some progress. I also spent time organizing some of the notes and resources I have that are coding related to make them more efficient and logically structured.</p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Continued with Module 2. Finished the sticky positioning section.</p>
                
                <p>Sticky positioning is definitely an interesting declaration. It is tied with scrolling. Without scrolling sticky will do nothing. </p>
                
                <p>It has 2 requirements: <code class='code-inline'>position: sticky</code> and at least one top/left/bottom/right value declared, which assigns where the element will stick. </p>
                
                <p>If we set the top value to 0, then what this means is that the element will stick to directly onto the parent’s top edge. If the page scrolls down, then the stickiness occurs at the viewport’s edge until the bottom edge of the parent container is reached. The sticky element cannot leave the boundary of its parent, except with negative top/left/bottom/right values.</p>
                
                <p>Because sticky positioning is tied to scrolling, this means that setting an overflow property on any of the sticky elements ancestors will impact how the element sticks. If the parent has overflow auto, hidden, or scroll set, but doesn’t have a fixed height set along with overflowing content, then it will appear as if sticky positioning is “not working”. It’s a similar situation that occurs if the parent doesn’t have overflow set, but also isn’t tall (or wide) enough.</p>
                
                <p>I created a nifty reference project with a sticky header and some cool sticky section labels that I will most likely be using on a portfolio or resume project in the future. </p>

                <h3>Building: Space Tourism Site</h3>
                <p>Continued with the Design System page.</p>
                
                <p>Realizing that building this page is mostly about practice. Building it out isn’t very helpful for identifying component patterns or design patterns because all the markup here is outside of the context of the actual website itself. </p>
                
                <p>The most challenging thing of this is simply naming the classes. Sometimes the class name is mostly accurate. For example, in the Typography section, there is a sub-headings component and I created a styling class for the header of this component and because I didn’t see a reason to create a whole new class for the ‘body text’ section (it was using almost all the same styling, except for the color), I used this class name on it. </p>
                
                <p>A fix for the problem would be to come up with a less specific class name. However, naming things is a bitch.</p>
                
                <p>This pain of naming is actually a good case for using utility classes. Instead of creating a new class for each of the headings and subheadings I was able to utilize the utility classes to quickly style them within the HTML. </p>
                
                <p>After I prepped the page I continued watching the tutorial. This is definitely the better order. Make first then watch. Yes, it may mean me redoing some of the work I’ve done as I learn how to do something more efficiently, but this is not bad at all. Making “mistakes,” for me at least, is the best way to learn.</p>
                
                <p>This actually reinforced a decision I made when it came to the numbered titles on the page. Because all of these shared the same kind of styling I created a class instead of using utility classes. This is exactly what Kevin Powell did, however he did it a bit more efficiently. </p>
                
                <p>When I selected for the titles I used element sectors, whereas he created an actual class with a perfectly descriptive name, “numbered-title.” (Why the hell didn’t I think of that?!).</p>
                
                <p>I then went ahead and finished the last section of the design system on my own. I will watch the tutorial on how he did this and make adjustments where necessary. </p>
                
                <p>I did mess around with using inline-styles, despite myself. Specifically I used this for specifying different values for variables. I am not so sure about this workflow though. But I think messing with it is allowing me to come up with an experiential reason why to avoid them (or use them).</p>

                <p>Wrapped up stacking contexts by learning about portals, which are libraries of a sort to use when working with React. These allow one to create modals that will be rendered alongside the root element, thus allowing DOM order to control the stacking order by declaring <code class='code-inline'>isolation: isolate</code> on the root element.</p>
                
                <p>Right now this is now so relevant, but I made a note of it.</p>
                
                <p>I moved on, learning about Fixed Position. Fixed position is always in relation to the viewport.</p>
                
                <p>When searching about the default positioned ancestor on an absolutely positioned element that does not have an ancestor with a position declaration I have seen people say that it is the body element. However through some explorations I have not found this to be so true. What I did find is that the viewport is the parent. This is also the case with Fixed position.</p>
                
                <p>There are exceptions to this rule. The first exception is that if there is any ancestor, no matter how far up the DOM tree that has a transform declaration, then the fixed element will behave as an absolutely positioned element in relation to this ancestor.</p>
                
                <p>The other exception is if an ancestor has a declaration of  <code class='code-inline'>will-change: transform</code>. </p>
                
                <p>There is a pretty nifty script that Josh introduced to hunt up the DOM tree to find the parent. This script is simple, yet quite helpful. I love things like this.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Travel Website</h3>
                <p>I updated the stylesheet to implement certain naming schemes I saw Kevin Powell use. </p>
                
                <p>I decided I liked his naming scheme for CSS Variables. Specifically using the prefix of ‘fs’ for font-sizes, and ‘ff’ for font-family. Using these makes it really easy to find them when working further down in the stylesheet. </p>
                
                <p>I also like how he used the relative values for his font size utility classes. His naming scheme is to use the font-weight number scale (100-900). At first I was hesitant to use this, but it started to make sense to me. The reason it makes sense is because font-size is being set with rem units and so, yes these are based on pixels, but ultimately this value is dependent upon the user. </p>
                
                <p>It is more accurate to use this relative scale, then to call them by the pixel name. Before this I was not using font-size utility classes and would be declaring them using var(--150px), etc. This would only be accurate if the user does not change the browser default font-size. Naming is already hard enough, the least I can do is do my best to use naming schemes that are more accurate, such as this.</p>
                
                <p>I began rebuilding the design system page from the ground up and using less utility classes. I am curious if there is a benefit to having more classes on an element or more rules in the stylesheet. I am still learning the balance and projects like this are the perfect way to find that balance.</p>
                
                <h3>Building: Reference Projects</h3>
                <p>I created a remote repo for some of the projects I created recently that are serving as reference projects.  So far this consists of Centering with Absolute Positioning, Tooltip, and a Stacking Contexts project.</p>
                
                <p>I have been using my laptop for the last few weeks, but I also have several projects on my desktop computer that I am planning on adding to this repo. This makes for more good practice with pushing and pulling using git.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for Developers</h3>
                <p>I started today by rebuilding the tooltips reference project and adding a README file for it which explained the thought process behind each of the properties. </p>
                
                <p>This was helpful for me. Yesterday I was a bit overwhelmed by all the parts involved in making these, but there was definitely some information digestion in the time period between then and now. </p>
                
                <p>Continuing with Module 2 and learning about stacking contexts. I do have a decent understanding about how these works. At this point they feel pretty intuitive. </p>
                
                <p>I did learn about new ways to create stacking contexts. The one declaration I am particularly excited about is isolation: isolate. I like the way this behaves in that it requires the least amount of code to create a stacking context.</p>

                <h3>Building: Space Travel Website</h3>
                <p>Decided to watch a bit of the tutorial that goes along with this project to see if I could pick up on some pointers. The tutorial is done by Kevin Powell and I do find some of his stuff to be helpful.</p>
                
                <p>As I was watching, I remembered that I don’t like following project tutorials. I just feel like it’s cheating myself of valuable experience. With that said I did learn a few things as far as creating css utility classes and using CSS variables. </p>
                
                <p>I am definitely interested in seeing how the images are implemented. I can see there are various size images for the different layouts (mobile, tablet, desktop) and I have been meaning to learn about using the srcset attribute. I will be checking the tutorial out for that. </p>
                
                <p>Tomorrow I will be getting back to the Cube CSS methodology and will be using the tutorial for this project only when I want an idea of how something is done as opposed to watching all the videos. Having a tutorial to follow is okay, but also unrealistic. Part of the fun of these projects is encountering something I don’t know and having to find the answer. So as I go along I will learn how to balance this.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Learning about Positioning Layout. </p>
                
                <p>One difference between how relative and absolute positioning works is to what top, right, bottom, left values are relative. With relative positioning these are relative to the position the element sits within the flow. With absolute positioning these values are relative to the nearest ancestor with a positioning layout value set (position: static/initial is not a positioning layout value; it is the value of a flow layout element). </p>
                
                <p>Learned a couple ways to center absolutely positioned elements using the top, right, bottom, left values along with margin: auto. </p>
                
                <p>There was a short challenge which had me create a tooltip. This highlighted a use case for absolute positioning. It also involved some of the finer points of how absolutely positioning works in relationship to its positioned parent and that parent’s display value. </p>
                
                <p>I created 2 reference projects for both centering and for the tooltip so I can refer back to them in the future.  </p>

                <h3>Building: Frontend Mentor - Space Travel Website</h3>
                <p>I picked a project on Frontend Mentor to start today. At first I was a bit overwhelmed. This is usual whenever I begin a project. However, I have, over the last several months, developed a trust in the process.</p>
                
                <p>The process starts with simply setting up the project itself. Getting the project directories set up, downloading assets, and looking over the design templates and setting up the remote repo. </p>
                
                <p>I made some notes of the things I know I will need to look up, such as making a hamburger menu (I’ll be using <a href="https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/" target="_blank">this tutorial on building hamburger menus</a> when the time comes), as well as other navigational features.</p>
                
                <p>After doing this I felt the excitement overtake the overwhelm. The journey has begun and I have a map of what to do.</p>
                
                <p>This <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3" target="_blank">specific project</a> is part of the free projects available on Frontend Mentor, but this one does give access to the Figma design files. This is helpful because there is much more information about the design, such as font sizes and colors to use. I spent some time looking that over and prepping some the css styles. </p>
                
                <p>I also decided to start reading about <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/cube-css/" target="_blank">Andy Bell’s Cube CSS methodology</a> and do my best to apply the principles to this project. Immediate application really is the best way to learn.</p>
                
                <p>I will also be reinforcing a mobile-first design approach and will be continuing Comeau’s CSS for JavaScript Developers course applying those learnings to this project as well.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes I try too hard to plan things out, but I feel there is value, at my stage, in getting in there and making a bit of a mess. A lot of realizations come from that and make for better experience when it comes to planning in the future. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Completed module 1 today. </p>
                
                <p>Learned about the complexities of margin collapse, which I had no idea about before. I will not say I am an expert at it, but now I have more familiarity with how it works. </p>
                
                <p>A case was even made to avoid margins altogether, which I thought was interesting. The context of this has to do with thinking in styled components. The idea being that component edges shouldn’t impact their outer environment and this makes sense to me. </p>
                
                <p>There was an end of module challenge which I was able to complete without too much trouble at all. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Revisited my CSS reset stylesheet and compared and contrast it with both <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/">Josh’s</a> and <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/">Andy Bell’s</a> (2 developers I look up to).</p>
                
                <p>Some things I adopted into my own CSS are scroll-behavior being set to smooth on the root element and a media query for users that prefer reduced motion. The latter sets the scroll-behavior to its default as well as reduces animation and transition durations. </p>
                
                <p>Much of today’s learning was review for me, but useful review. What was reviewed and gone over in detail was the Box Model. There was good practice in reiterating the difference between content-box and border-box and it makes even more sense now.</p>
                
                <p>Learned about a nifty feature of the margin property: by setting negative margins on left and right an element can be stretched.</p>
                
                <p>I also learned that the fit-content width value requires a vendor prefix for Firefox. I love encountering things like this. Information that corrects and updates my current mental models seem to stick so much more.</p>
                
                <p>I also learned more about the Flow Layout and the different behaviors of the display values: block, inline, and inline-block.</p>
                
                <p>Again, this was most review, but these are foundational aspects so reviewing doesn’t hurt.</p>
                
                <p>Next up I went through the section on width. I learned some stuff here.</p>
                
                <p>Specifically I learned about the difference between width: auto (this is the default value) and width: 100%. When the width of an element is set to 100% it means that the element’s content-box will always be 100% the size of its parent. If horizontal margin is added to the element, then there’s a chance the element may break out of its parent because that margin will be added to the width which is already 100%. This is good to know~</p>
                
                <p>I also learned about some keywords to use for width. In addition to fit-content, which I already knew about, I learned about min-content and max-content. These keywords are interesting because they are intrinsic values, which means the width is not based on the parent (extrinsic), but is based on the width of the children.</p>
                
                <p>With min-content this means the element looks for the longest single word and then makes its width be equal to that word. That longest word becomes the width of the element.</p>
                
                <p>With max-content the width of the element is equal to the width of the widest child. If a header is very long it means the width will be as long as that line is without any line-breaks. This can break outside of a parent. </p>
                
                <p>Both of these methods are interesting ways to shrink wrap content, but the most straight-forward one seems to be fit-content (just have to be sure to add the vendor prefix for Firefox!)</p>

                <p>Finished Chapter 10: Prototypes</p>
                
                <p>This is the last chapter in this course. </p>
                
                <p>I spent some time learning about prototype chains awhile back. This chapter helped me better understand what these are, especially in the context of the ‘wiring’ mental model.</p>
                
                <p>Prototypes are mostly relevant when reading property values. If a property is being written, this will occur on the object that the property is being written to, not a prototype.</p>
                
                <p>It is possible to write to an object’s prototype. This is called Prototype Pollution and for the most part should be avoided. </p>
                
                <p>Every newly created object has as its prototype a default Object Prototype which is where all those fancy methods and properties live and are accessible from. The prototype of the Object Prototype is just null. This is the end of the line for every prototype chain. </p>
                
                <p>Like properties, prototype chains are unidirectional. They flow down stream in the form of object chains. A prototype cannot access the properties of the object of which it is a prototype. </p>
                
                <p>This course was simply awesome. Probably one of the most useful courses I have taken in my coding journey. I will most likely be revisiting it over and over. </p>
                
                <p>The exercises provided were crucial for reinforcing the mental model. I am looking forward to diving into some projects to continue the reinforcement. </p>

                <p>Finished Chapter 9: Mutations</p>
                
                <p>This chapter was enlightening. I now know with surety what object mutation is and how to avoid it if necessary. </p>
                
                <p>Mutation is altering the property values of an object that is already created. </p>
                
                <p>I also learned about the const keyword and due to the mental model of wires I can grasp its usage much more clearly. The ‘const’ keyword only prevents rewiring the value a variable is connect to, but will not prevent mutation of an object. </p>
                
                <p>The concept that objects are never nested within other objects was also reinforced into my mental model. I’ve said it before, but this makes so much more sense than thinking of properties of objects and variables in terms of boxes. The ‘box’ mental model has beeb stayed and its death is most welcome.</p>
                
                <p>One thing I realized that was not mentioned in the course is how the flow of the wires of object value properties is uni-directional. It flows out from the object value that the property was ‘born’ from,  but does not flow backwards. This makes perfect sense when a property is wired to a primitive value, but can be confusing when a property is wired to another object value. </p>

                <p>This is supposed to be a day off, but I just can’t help myself here.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Just JavaScript</h3>
                <p>Today I went through Chapter 8: Properties.</p>
                
                <p>This expands on the variable mental model of wires connecting to values. Essentially properties behave like wires and just like all wires in this mental model they must be connected to a value. </p>
                
                <p>One difference between properties and variables is that variables are code which point/connect to values. Properties don’t start from code, but start from values (object values). Variables are code connecting to values; properties are values connecting to other values. </p>
                
                <p>Another aspect is that properties are not inside objects, but are simply connections that are grouped together via the object value. The object value is a sort of hub for values and the properties are what connect the values to the hub. </p>
                
                <p>The reason this is helpful is because the values of connected to properties are available to other variables and other object values. They don’t enter the object to gain access, but simply connect via their own wires to these values. </p>
                
                <p>How can something be in two boxes at the same time? This is the problem with the box mental model. The wire mental model is more accurate in explaining the behavior of variables and properties. </p>
                
                <p>I also learned about what the ‘this’ keyword does. The course doesn’t go over ‘this’ but through one of the problems I learned more about it.</p>
                
                <pre><code>//The code below would throw an error because the 'next' property is pointing to the 'president' variable's value before it has been declared. 
                
let president = {
    name: "Goofy",
    next: president
}
                
// Without the 'this' keyword this is accomplished like so:
                
let president = {
    name: "Goofy",
}

president.next = president;
                
//The same thing above can be accomplished with less code by using the 'this' keyword:
                
let president = {
    name: "Goofy",
    next: this,
}</code></pre>
                <p>When an object gets more complicated ‘this’ becomes even more useful. Encountering this problem helped me understand how ‘this’ behaves and what it replaces. I now have a better grasp on what ‘this’ is abstracting. </p>
                
                <p>I also learned about how the dot operator works in regards to accessing properties. </p>
                
                <p>If the value to the left of the ‘.’ is undefined or null an error is thrown, otherwise it moves forward.</p>
                
                <p>This makes sense because ‘undefined’ and ‘null’ are primitive values and do not posses any properties in and of themselves. </p>
                
                <p>If a property of an object hasn’t been declared, trying to access it will result in undefined. This does not mean that in doing so a property is created and wired to the value ‘undefined’. In other languages trying to access a property that doesn’t exist would result in an error. In the Universe that is JavaScript, this results in the value ‘undefined’. It’s just a law of this Universe. </p>

                <p>I found this article informative. It revealed a bad habit I have developed of using pixels for font sizes. This is bad for accessibility reasons. Moving forward I will be using rem units for font-sizing.</p>
                
                <p>He made an interesting case for using ems for vertical margins, which prevents excess code writing. For example: if I wanted my margins for all headers no matter what type to be 0.75x their font-size size I would have to calculate that value for every header if I were using rem units. However if I were to use ems for the margins I could just have one rule with a selector for all headers and set the margin (vertical) to 0.75em and this would take care of it  that size, then I would have to calculate that rem value.</p>
                
                <p>The article also made a very interesting case for using rem units for media queries. I am still wrapping my head around this. The example he uses to highlight the usefulness of doing this has to do with a page layout that has a vertical navigation on the left hand side. If a user bumped the default browser font size to 32px and pixels were used in the media query, then the navigation would end up taking up a larger portion of the available space, squeezing the main content. </p>
                
                <p>By using rems for the media query, when the user bumps up the font size, then the media query breakpoints would also change. In this case what would occur is the page would be following the mobile specifications and the navigation would become collapsible. This is pretty neat!</p>
                
                <p>The article was very thorough and offered some interesting workflows and I applied some of the ideas to this website and am looking forward to making these ideas a part of my workflow.</p>
                
                <p>With that said it was also emphasized that there are no hard rules and that the more projects we build the more our intuition will build in regards to determining what kinds of units to use.</p>
                
                <p>He left me with a good mental model for deciding in the form of a simple, yet powerful question: Do I want this to scale up when a user changes a browser’s default font size?</p>
                
                <p>It’s all about the mental models these days. I love em!</p>

                <h3>Learning CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Continued with the introductory module.</p>
                
                <p>Went over colors and the 3 main keywords to use to set colors (RGB, Hexadecimal, and HSL). </p>
                
                <p>A pretty good case was made for using HSL. The argument is that HSL is much more intuitive. If a we want a color darker we adjust the light percentage, 100% being fully white and 0% fully black (default is therefore 50%). If we want a color to be less vibrant we reduce the Saturation percentage. </p>
                
                <p>One thing I don’t like about HSL is that it is mathematical and so there are aspects that are not so intuitive. Brightness (saturation) is one of these aspects. Humans don’t perceive color saturation equally across colors. Given equal saturation some colors will appear to our eyes to be more or less bright than they actually are. It’s similar with sound: low frequencies will sound quieter than higher frequencies at the same decibel level. And even this changes based on the overall decibel level. </p>
                
                <p>I am still debating which color keyword to use moving forward, but I will experiment with HSL for a time to see how I like it.</p>
                
                <p>Another thing covered has to do with units: pixels, ems, rems and percentages.</p>
                
                <p>I’ve heard many different preferences. Josh prefers rems, which I like as well as there is a single point of truth to which all rems units are relative. </p>
                
                <p>He did mention that when setting the font-size on the root element to avoid using pixels and instead use percentages. This is because when we set a font-size in pixels on the root element this will overwrite a user’s preference and I agree that this should be avoided. By using percentages it will adjust the site’s font size relative to the user preference. </p>
                
                <p>I was a bit sad that vh vw and vmax were not mentioned, but they may come up later. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>I have been meaning to start this course for a long time. I am a big fan of Josh Comeau. I purchased this course almost a year ago.</p>

                <p>I got started on the first Module (module 0). This was all review so far, but is helpful for getting used to how the course is structured and for what’s to come.</p>
                
                <p>I sense so much integrity in Josh and his work and so far this course is exceeding expectations.</p>
                
                <p>Again, this guy is super inspiring for me and is an example of how I’d like to be as a coder and as a contributor to the world of coding. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Just JavaScript</h3>
                <h4>Chapter 6: Meeting Objects and Functions</h4>
                <p>Objects and functions are both values. These are values that can be summoned (similar to primitive values), but in order for an object value and function value to be summoned it first must be created. </p>

                <p>That’s right! Objects and functions are values that we get to create! Joy!</p>
                
                <p>There are many types of objects. Dates, arrays, RegExps, Number, Math, etc.</p>
                
                <p>Objects can be created, but not destroyed. JavaScript has a garbage collection, but when this occurs cannot be guaranteed. </p>
                
                <p>Functions are objects, but with special properties. Functions possess the capabilities of objects, but not necessarily vice versa.</p>
                
                <p>When a variable is wired up to a function value, that function is created at that point in time. </p>
                
                <p>If another variable is created an wired to a function value that looks the same, it does not wire up to the same function value; a new function value is created. To wire up a variable to the same function value, then the variable must point to the function value already wired up to the other variable. (Ex: let oldVariable = function(){}; let newVariable = oldVariable;)</p>
                
                <p>In order for the code within the function body to be run, it must be called using ‘().’ When a function is called it is a <i>call expression.</i> The call expression is answered by JavaScript by running the code, resulting in whatever value is returned.</p>
                
                <p>Writing it out:</p>

                <pre><code>
let plant = function () {
    return {};
};

let tree = plant();

let flower = plant();
                </code></pre>
                
                <p>The first line created a variable called ‘plant’ and wires this up to a newly created function value.</p>
                
                <p>The second line creates a new variable called ‘tree’ and wires it up to another newly created object.</p>
                
                <p>That process looks like this: </p>
                <p>The plant variable expression results in a function value. This function value enters into the call expression, which results in an object literal expression, which results in a newly created object. </p>
                
                <p>The third line creates a new variable called ‘flower’ and runs the same process above and is wired up to another new object.</p>
                
                <p>After all this code runs there are 3 newly created values! A function value and two distinct object values. </p>

                <h4>Chapter 7: Equality of Values</h4>

                <p>There are three kinds of equality: Strict Equality (a === b), Loose Equality (a == b) and Same Value Equality (Object.is(a, b)).</p>

                <p>I have not encountered Same Value Equality yet, but this chapter started with it. </p>
                
                <p>Due to the mental models of values that has been set up throughout the course so far, Same Value Equality is easy to grasp. Where I once would have been confused (objects), I am no longer confused due to what I learned in Chapter 5. </p>
                
                <p>Strict Equality almost behaves the same, except for two special cases. </p>
                
                <p>Both cases deal with primitive special numerical cases.</p>
                
                <p>The first one has to do with NaN. With Strict Equality NaN === NaN is always false, whereas Object.is(NaN, NaN) is true. </p>
                
                <p>The second case has to do with -0 and 0. We know that -0 and 0 are individual and unique values and Same Value Equality shows this is the case:</p>
                
                <p>Object.is(-0, 0) will result in false, whereas -0 === 0 will always result in true. </p>
                
                <p>Out of these two special cases the one that will most likely be encountered is the case dealing with NaN. In order to check that a value is NaN we can do one of three things:</p>
                <p>Object.is(someVariable, NaN)</p>
                <p>Number.isNaN(someVariable)</p>
                <p>someVariable !== someVariable</p>
                
                <p>Out in the world, Strict Equality is what I will be using fo the most part, but it is super helpful to be aware fo those two special cases, especially the first. </p>
                
                <p>As for Loose Equality, I got one word: YUCK.</p>
                
                <p>I will not be using it if I can avoid it.</p>
                
                <p>Here is a useful resource which shows all the strange results of Loose Equality: <a href="https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/">JS Comparison Table</a></p>
                
                <p>This course doesn’t cover it so much and essentially warns to use with caution. </p>
                
                <p>But again, I am simply going to avoid the use altogether. </p>
                
                <p>One potential useful use case is: variableName == null</p>
                
                <p>This is like this: someVariable === null || someVariable === undefined</p>
                
                <p>But seriously? Is that really that much more code to write? I say no.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Just JavaScript</h3>
                <h4>Chapter 3: Values and Variables</h4>
                <p>A number of mental models were established within this chapter.</p>

                <p>These mental models build on the mental model of values and are related to variables.</p>
                
                <p>These mental models are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Primitive values are immutable. Object and functions are mutable.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are wires; they are associations between the variable name and the value.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are not values, but wires connecting to values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are expressions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables cannot point to other variables, only to values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are never ‘passed’ into functions; the value the variable points to is what is passed.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Chapter 4: Studying from the Inside</h4>
                <p>This mental model helps to isolate the focus.</p>

                <p>Any programming involves so many layers of abstraction and it can get easy to get lost in these layers. This mental model holds us within the appropriate layer. </p>
                
                <p>We don’t care about how the computer stores the memory and how all that craziness works. It’s just a distraction. What we care about are the qualities, characteristics and governing laws of JavaScript. That’s what we study. </p>
                
                <p>The foundation is: Values are not code. Most values are immutable. Variables are pointers to values, are connected to values through ‘wires.’ Expressions are questions that JavaScript can answer. These answers are in the form of variables. </p>
                
                <h4>Chapter 5: The Primitive Values</h4>
                <p>I am appreciating the order this chapter is introducing these: in order of how many values there are of each primitive data type.</p>

                <p>Undefined has one and only one flavor of its value and that is undefined.  </p>
                
                <p>Null is similar.  Null does have the typeof quirk, but other than that the difference is more human related than machine related. The machine treats them the same. In regards to human it all has to do with intention. Undefined represents unintentionally missing values, whereas null represents intentionally missing values.</p>
                
                <p>Boolean values have two flavors: true and false. There are not multiple trues, nor are there multiple false. However each flavor can have infinite numbers of wires connecting them to different variables. </p>
                
                <p>Numbers. These have so many flavors. However the amount is not limited. Numbers also behave in quirky ways due to their floating-point nature. Their precision of reduces the further we get from 0. There are also special numbers: NaN, -Infinity, and Infinity, which exist to account for special circumstances.</p>
                
                <p>BigInts allow are arbitrary-precision integers. Not fully sure what that means, but it expands JavaScript’s numerical capabilities. These can be created by simply adding an ’n’ to the end of any integer. These are important when it comes to certain areas of finance.</p>
                
                <p>Strings have many flavors as well. Every character and pattern of characters represents a unique flavor of string. Based on our Inside JavaScript mental model, all strings already exist, we do not create them, but essentially summon them. Also strings have special properties that seem similar to those of arrays (objects), but these properties don’t behave exactly the same because strings are primitive and immutable.</p>
                
                <p>Symbols. These are not touched upon very much because they involve learning more about objects and so for now it is enough to know that they are similar to keys and they allows us to store/hide information inside an object and set what parts of the code can access that information.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Atomic Design</h3>
                <p>Finished the book today. The last 2 chapters were useful for giving me a good idea of what it’s like to work within a team environment in the industry.</p>

                <p>They weren’t too relevant to my current situation because most of the content was targeted towards someone who is currently working within a team and is wanting to implement design systems.</p>
                
                <p>My overall takeaway from this book is an appreciation for the design systems as whole and an excitement to implement them in my own projects.</p>
                
                <p>The design system approach feels more holistic and robust and it will become a part of my foundation as I move forward.</p>
                
                <p>I do wish there was more coverage on how to actually implement a pattern library. Chapter 3 did go over this somewhat, but it didn’t get into the details, which, to be fair, were most likely beyond the scope of the book itself. </p>
                
                <p>Things I want to learn more about going forward are how template languages work with data in the form of JSON to fill in component patterns with content.</p>
                
                <p>The most valuable chapters for me are chapters 2 and 3 and I will be revisiting these as I move forward. </p>
                
                <p>Moving forward I will also be utilizing companies’ style guides for inspiration and direction. Specifically I will be diving into Google’s Material. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts and Review: Atomic Design</h3>
                <p>Reviewing what I’ve learned so far in the Atomic Design course. </p>

                <p>Atoms are the simplest pieces. These are buttons, specific kinds of text (headers, descriptions, excerpts, paragraphs), specific kinds of images (profile pics, hero images, logos)</p>
                
                <p>Molecules are combinations of atoms to form larger functional pieces such as a search input with its search button.</p>
                
                <p>Organisms bring together molecules to form even more complex functional patterns consisting of combinations of atoms, molecules and even other organisms. Example would be a header which contains a navigation organism, a logo atom and a search molecule. </p>
                
                <p>Templates are how these things are brought together within a page. Templates are generic pages with generic content. These begin to give us an idea of how all the organisms come together to form an experience.</p>
                
                <p>Pages bring in the specific content to give a finished look. This is also the stage where we can really begin to test out variations in content, using test cases to wrinkle out any issues. </p>
                
                <p>How this is actually implemented within a design system involves file/directory structure, naming conventions for the files, templating languages, such as Mustache, testing data (can be in the form of JSON), the variations of data (default/filler, best case data, variation scenarios). </p>
                
                <p>This also involves documenting, annotating and providing component lineages. Documenting is about describing what each component, usually in the form of an organism or a molecule, is for, how it is to be used, and other details that can be helpful for designers and developers. Documentation also involves providing a means to view the code related to the component in all the necessary layers (template code, rendered html, css) and to see the finished result. </p>
                
                <p>Annotating is useful and is essentially a way to put the components within the context of an actual page and giving the capability to click on a button to reveal all the documentation related to the component itself.</p>
                
                <p>Documenting the component lineage is a part of documentation as well. This provides information on what atoms, molecules, organisms make up the component, as well as what organisms contain the component. It goes both downward and upward. This is useful for testing, troubleshooting and adjusting.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Atomic Design</h3>
                <p>Finished Chapter 4. This chapter broke down a potential workflow from idea to full implantation and how that looks in a non-linear/waterfall way.</p>

                <p>It started by going over the standard way of moving a project from ida to finished product, which is linear and how this doesn’t make sense in the environment of web development. </p>
                
                <p>My take aways from it: a project can be broken into 3 sections/teams (this is another abstracted layer): UX, Visual Design, and Front-End Development. These layers are in a constant dance with one another. </p>
                
                <p>For the UX, creating lo-fi sketches is more useful than full on mockups. It’s about creating the minimum viable product to create discussion.</p>
                
                <p>Visual designers can utilize a method called the 20 second gut check, which I think is pretty cool. It involves gathering a number of other similar sites, spending 20 secs looking at each and ranking them. After this, it’s about discussing the one’s that received low marks, high marks and the ones that received both low and high marks from different people. The next phase involves creating style tiles and elemental components.</p>
                
                <p>Front-end developers can start to set up project dependencies, get the file structure down, and begin marking up basic patterns so that early design ideas can be seen in the context of the web earlier. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Atomic Design</h3>

                <p>I finished chapter 3 and started in on chapter 4 of Atomic Design</p>

                <p>Chapter 3 gave me an overview of what a Pattern Library would look like when implemented. </p>
                
                <p>Pattern libraries consist of a file structure, naming conventions, template language (this one uses Mustache), data (this uses JSON), code views, documentation and annotations, and contextual documentation.</p>
                
                <p>I can see the power of and the beauty in creating systems that take all these into account. I am looking forward to implementing them.</p>
                
                <p>For some reason I get really excited about these kinds of systems. It is probably my OCD. </p>
                
                <p>Chapter 4 went over how to create buy-in for establishing a design system, which isn’t too relevant for me right now as I am not trying to sell this to anyone at the moment. I am already bought in to utilizing this. </p>
                
                <p>However this chapter was awesome at going over what good web design needs to take into account. Aspects such as being accessible within the limitations of a human and a device, layering enhancements based on form-factors and device capabilities, being future-friendly and able to take advantage of newer technology (watches, vehicles, smart glasses, etc).</p>

                <h3>Learning: Just Javascript</h3>

                <p><a href="https://justjavascript.com/">Just JavaScript</a> is a course that I purchased not too long ago. It is created by Dan Abramov and Maggie Appleton.</p>

                <p>It teaches the fundamentals of JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>I started it today and what follows are some thoughts about the 2 chapters I went through today.</p>
                
                <p>So far I am enjoying it very much.</p>

                <h4>Chapter One</h4>

                <p>This chapter is all about revealing the power of mental models. They exist whether we are aware of them or not. Becoming aware of them is important and foundational in being the best coder we can be.</p>

                <p>The chapter wraps mental models into the reality of the two speeds at which we think: fast and slow.</p>
                
                <p>Fast thinking involves patterned habitual, thinking and requires little energy. </p>
                
                <p>Slow thinking involves the ability to plan out, re- and de-structure, and take apart a process piece by piece to understand what is happening in order to make what we want to happen happen.</p>
                
                <p>Having accurate mental models is important for both fast thinking and slow thinking.</p>
                
                <p>Accurate mental models lead to less bugs and more efficient debugging. </p>
                
                <p>It is often the case that bugs arise when our fast thinking is based on inaccurate mental models. These bugs require us to enter into slow thinking mode. </p>
                
                <p>When we enter the more laborious slow thinking mode we can, if we are attentive, expose the flaws in our mental models as our mental model is what we are using to step through the process piece by piece. </p>
                
                <p>With the right mentality, bugs become opportunities for growth.</p>
                
                <h4>Chapter Two</h4>

                <p>This chapter was about values. </p>

                <p>The mental model of this chapter is: Values are not code.</p>
                
                <p>The concept that values are separate from code was one I haven’t encountered, but I think it is an important one. Our code is what moves values around and utilizes values. </p>
                
                <p>Values however are not dependent upon code. They exist whether there is code or not. They are the raw material waiting to be used. Like granite. It is there whether or not it is “programmed” into being a counter top. </p>
                
                <p>The elucidation of expressions was helpful as well. Expressions are questions that JavaScript can answer and the answer will always be in the form of a value. </p>
                
                <p>Values themselves come in 9 and only 9 types. There are two broad categories of values: primitive values and then objects and functions. It was made clear that functions are essentially types of objects, but they are special enough to warrant a pseudo-separation from objects. </p>
                
                <p>Primitive values are the most raw material and consist of numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbols, and bigints.</p>
                
                <p>Then there are objects and functions which are values, but can be interacted with uniquely using code. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Spent some time writing some more about the relationships of content, design and structure. I am finding this to be extremely helpful and grounding. All the learning that is to come will be rooted in better, more fertile soil due to having a better understanding of the context web design and development occurs within.</p>

                <p>I am coming to learn that I do have certain opinions. For instance, content itself needs to be the boss. Mostly. There is a lot of interplay between content, design, and structure, and yet there is also a main current that flows mostly in a certain direction. </p>
                
                <p>Design and structure should, for the most part be following the lead of content. Editing of content should be occurring outside of what colors and type it will be using and where and how it will be displayed. </p>
                
                <p>With that said, I know there are some books that had to be edited because the book itself needed to be shorter. In these cases structure is an editing factor on the content. But perhaps the structural needs only highlighted missed opportunities for creating more impactful content, forcing hard questions to be asked and darlings to be killed. In this sense structure didn’t necessarily do the editing, but rather created the impetus for improved editing.</p>
                
                <p>In this manner there is always bi-directional flow occurring, but for the most part content is king (or queen) and the flow is from content to design and structure.</p>
                
                <p>Content has a purpose and that purpose informs the style of voice that conveys the words. The purpose and voice are crucial factors when it comes to making design decisions. The color, textures, and typography need to support the purpose and voice of the content. There is simply no reason for this to have any back flow.</p>
                
                <p>Artistically, perhaps it could be fun to start with the limitation of using the color blue and letting that color’s psychological implications generate content. But for the most part this is not the case. </p>
                
                <p>When it comes to structure it gets interesting. There is an obvious connection between content and HTML semantic structure. The structure of the HTML will follow the structure of the content. </p>
                
                <p>But there are other structural aspects that aren’t necessarily dependent on the content itself, but rather are there to make sure that the content is flexibly visible and accessible. This involves external and internal layers.</p>
                
                <p>Externally, this means that the user is able to come into contact with the content. This contact must be able to occur within the majority of circumstances a user may find themselves. These circumstances are inherent to the user (blindness, deafness, motor impairment, etc.) and inherent to the device (screen sizes, interface differences, etc).</p>
                
                <p>Internally, this means that designers, developers and project managers are able to communicate with one another using a shared language that creates internal cohesion. This in turn would greatly benefit the stakeholders for what should be obvious reasons.  </p>
                
                <p>The flow between these internal and external structural layers is very much a bi-directional flow. Externally, users encountering the content will have positive and negative experiences. Negative experiences need to be eliminated and positive experiences need to be supported and enhanced.</p>
                
                <p>There is a lot of testing in this and when the factors involved in decreasing negative experiences and increasing positive experiences are discovered, there needs to be efficient ways to implement those discoveries. This is where internal structure in the form of design systems become crucial.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning </h3>
                <p>Started Chapter 3 of Atomic Design. This chapter is getting into how to actually implement a Pattern Library system. The author has created his own system which can be used called <a href="https://patternlab.io/" target="_blank">Pattern Lab</a>.</p>

                <p>For now I am more interested is how this system is implemented than in using Pattern Lab itself.</p>
                
                <p>I enjoyed learning about the file structure and how the Mustache template library is used to implement the mental model of atoms, molecules and organisms. </p>
                
                <p>Learned about the importance of having layers of test data in the process. There is the the default data such as images that are essentially block of color with the dimension indicated for the image, then there is the test data which is a specific test instance with an actual image and actual text (not lorem ipsum). Then, to take a step further it is about creating other test cases that reveal the extremes of the ;layout, which really helps to weed out issues. </p>
                
                <p>The takeaways from today: project file structure, use of templating language, use of JSON for data test cases and how to implement layers of data throughout the process. I am really looking forward to implementing this in practice. </p>
                
                <p>I will finish this chapter tomorrow and perhaps even chapter 4.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Once I get my “system” of learning up and running fully Sunday’s will usually be my day off, fully. However today I have the desire to keep on keeping’ on for now. It doesn’t seem like work. It brings me joy.</p>

                <p>Today I further refined the distillations from yesterday. The biggest thing that fell into place for me is how modular design is linked to and informs the visual design (thinking about the idea that is Elemental Components). </p>
                
                <p>My rough diagram of how content gets styled and structured is becoming more delineated. There is a definite flow of well structured content into a design system. Now, I do realized there is always a sort of ebb and flow between all the processes in regards to structuring and styling content. It’s one of those Chicken and the Egg paradigms. </p>
                
                <p>Well-structured content  > Design System > Visual Design and Modular Design > Responsive layout and structure > Pattern Libraries. </p>
                
                <p>It seems to feed down into less abstraction, which then feeds back up through the more abstract layers. There is a constant motion between these  poles, moving from general to specific and back again. </p>

                <h3>Coding Journal Project Setup</h3>
                <p>This coding journal is meant to be a sort of daily (except Sundays, usually) place where I keep tabs on what the hell I am doing.</p>

                <p>This will also be a perfect means for me to practice design systems to a certain extent.</p>
                
                <p>I have a website setup at <a href="https://christhe.dev/" target="_blank">ChrisThe.Dev</a> and this journal is going to be the main content of it for now.</p>
                
                <p>I got this set up on the server and got some practice with pulling from GitHub as I am bouncing between a couple computers right now. This is good practice. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning </h3>
                <p>Today I went through chapter 2 of Atomic Design. I am really loving this book so far. It is also confirming of a lot of the thoughts I have been having lately. Many times I would see words and phrases used in the book that I myself have used. It’s just nice to see that.</p>

                <p>Here’s a distillation of chapter 2:</p>
                
                <p>Loving the mental model of using chemistry. This not only makes sense to me, but resonates with me in regards to involving models that represent natural phenomenon that are already well-established. This is called leverage and leverage is one of the core reasons why programming exists in the first place. Plus, I love chemistry. </p>
                
                <p>We have atoms, molecules, and organisms. These build upon each other logically. They also help inform one another.</p>
                
                <p>As we move up in complexity we start to enter into context. Atoms are outside of context, but combine to form context in the form of molecules, which combine to form a more solid context in the form of organisms. </p>
                
                <p>Once we move beyond organisms we then leave behind the chemistry model and enter into the context of the web itself. It starts with templates which is page dependent, but content independent and then it moves to pages which are content dependent.</p>
                
                <p>This is a progression from general to specific. Context evolves as the process moves forward and as we reach the most specific point we get to see how the atoms, molecules and organisms are serving there purpose. If something isn’t working we have the benefit of being able to make an informed decision regarding the level that the issue needs to be addressed. </p>
                
                <p>I am excited to learn more of this. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>No learning today; this was a day of consolidating what I learned yesterday when reading the first chapter of Atomic Design. I created a distillation of the learnings.</p>

                <p>This allowed me to get a better grip on how design systems work and how there are decreasing layers of abstraction.</p>
                
                <p>I think I am going to make Saturdays a consolidation day. A day of refining and revisiting the week’s learnings and potentially the day where I create a legitimate article is either published or at the point of being ready to publish. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>I spent a lot of time over the last few days creating a plan for how I will pursue my learning. </p>

                <p>I am learning that there is only so much planning that can be done and that I have reached that limit. It is an organic process of checking and changing. Make the plan, then do because the doing reveals a lot of information that will help further flesh out the plan and, most importantly, tie it to reality.</p>
                
                <p>The plan, for now, is structured into Learning, Building, Networking and Contributing, and Writing. </p>
                
                <p>I have learned that the Writing component is built into Learning and Building via the creation of writings.</p>
                
                <p>The writing occurs in stages. Most of the writing is for my own understanding. The writing is sloppy at first, just writing whatever comes to mind, but this gives me material to structure and potentially craft into an article. I make the block of stone and then I carve out David… at least that’s the dream haha!</p>
                
                <p>Writing is also built into Networking and Contributing via sharing the writings that are created, as well as sharing the knowledge gained through writing, which helps with my understanding. </p>
                
                <p>The purpose of writing is to concretize my understanding. It is the same concept as Rubber Duck Debugging. </p>

                <h3>Learnings</h3>
                <p>Today I started reading Atomic Design by Brad Frost. I read the first chapter and learned of the importance of design systems. I also learned about the limitations of using design apps such as Photoshop when it comes to building websites. I find that making this limitation explicit actually makes these apps more useful. </p>

                <p>I spent a good deal of time writing about what I learned. Trying to figure out a better way to distill this. The distilling is challenging for me currently, but the challenge is fun. It forces me to think about some logical flow. Plus it is the distilled writings that I will ultimately be able to offer to others as a form of contribution.</p>
