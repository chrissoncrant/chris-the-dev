                <h3>Building: Space Travel Website</h3>
                <p>Decided to watch a bit of the tutorial that goes along with this project to see if I could pick up on some pointers. The tutorial is done by Kevin Powell and I do find some of his stuff to be helpful.</p>
                
                <p>As I was watching, I remembered that I don’t like following project tutorials. I just feel like it’s cheating myself of valuable experience. With that said I did learn a few things as far as creating css utility classes and using CSS variables. </p>
                
                <p>I am definitely interested in seeing how the images are implemented. I can see there are various size images for the different layouts (mobile, tablet, desktop) and I have been meaning to learn about using the srcset attribute. I will be checking the tutorial out for that. </p>
                
                <p>Tomorrow I will be getting back to the Cube CSS methodology and will be using the tutorial for this project only when I want an idea of how something is done as opposed to watching all the videos. Having a tutorial to follow is okay, but also unrealistic. Part of the fun of these projects is encountering something I don’t know and having to find the answer. So as I go along I will learn how to balance this.</p>

                <p>Learning about Positioning Layout. </p>
                
                <p>One difference between how relative and absolute positioning works is to what top, right, bottom, left values are relative. With relative positioning these are relative to the position the element sits within the flow. With absolute positioning these values are relative to the nearest ancestor with a positioning layout value set (position: static/initial is not a positioning layout value; it is the value of a flow layout element). </p>
                
                <p>Learned a couple ways to center absolutely positioned elements using the top, right, bottom, left values along with margin: auto. </p>
                
                <p>There was a short challenge which had me create a tooltip. This highlighted a use case for absolute positioning. It also involved some of the finer points of how absolutely positioning works in relationship to its positioned parent and that parent’s display value. </p>
                
                <p>I created 2 reference projects for both centering and for the tooltip so I can refer back to them in the future.  </p>

                <h3>Building: Frontend Mentor - Space Travel Website</h3>
                <p>I picked a project on Frontend Mentor to start today. At first I was a bit overwhelmed. This is usual whenever I begin a project. However, I have, over the last several months, developed a trust in the process.</p>
                
                <p>The process starts with simply setting up the project itself. Getting the project directories set up, downloading assets, and looking over the design templates and setting up the remote repo. </p>
                
                <p>I made some notes of the things I know I will need to look up, such as making a hamburger menu (I’ll be using <a href="https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/" target="_blank">this tutorial on building hamburger menus</a> when the time comes), as well as other navigational features.</p>
                
                <p>After doing this I felt the excitement overtake the overwhelm. The journey has begun and I have a map of what to do.</p>
                
                <p>This <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3" target="_blank">specific project</a> is part of the free projects available on Frontend Mentor, but this one does give access to the Figma design files. This is helpful because there is much more information about the design, such as font sizes and colors to use. I spent some time looking that over and prepping some the css styles. </p>
                
                <p>I also decided to start reading about <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/cube-css/" target="_blank">Andy Bell’s Cube CSS methodology</a> and do my best to apply the principles to this project. Immediate application really is the best way to learn.</p>
                
                <p>I will also be reinforcing a mobile-first design approach and will be continuing Comeau’s CSS for JavaScript Developers course applying those learnings to this project as well.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes I try too hard to plan things out, but I feel there is value, at my stage, in getting in there and making a bit of a mess. A lot of realizations come from that and make for better experience when it comes to planning in the future. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Completed module 1 today. </p>
                
                <p>Learned about the complexities of margin collapse, which I had no idea about before. I will not say I am an expert at it, but now I have more familiarity with how it works. </p>
                
                <p>A case was even made to avoid margins altogether, which I thought was interesting. The context of this has to do with thinking in styled components. The idea being that component edges shouldn’t impact their outer environment and this makes sense to me. </p>
                
                <p>There was an end of module challenge which I was able to complete without too much trouble at all. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Revisited my CSS reset stylesheet and compared and contrast it with both <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/">Josh’s</a> and <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/">Andy Bell’s</a> (2 developers I look up to).</p>
                
                <p>Some things I adopted into my own CSS are scroll-behavior being set to smooth on the root element and a media query for users that prefer reduced motion. The latter sets the scroll-behavior to its default as well as reduces animation and transition durations. </p>
                
                <p>Much of today’s learning was review for me, but useful review. What was reviewed and gone over in detail was the Box Model. There was good practice in reiterating the difference between content-box and border-box and it makes even more sense now.</p>
                
                <p>Learned about a nifty feature of the margin property: by setting negative margins on left and right an element can be stretched.</p>
                
                <p>I also learned that the fit-content width value requires a vendor prefix for Firefox. I love encountering things like this. Information that corrects and updates my current mental models seem to stick so much more.</p>
                
                <p>I also learned more about the Flow Layout and the different behaviors of the display values: block, inline, and inline-block.</p>
                
                <p>Again, this was most review, but these are foundational aspects so reviewing doesn’t hurt.</p>
                
                <p>Next up I went through the section on width. I learned some stuff here.</p>
                
                <p>Specifically I learned about the difference between width: auto (this is the default value) and width: 100%. When the width of an element is set to 100% it means that the element’s content-box will always be 100% the size of its parent. If horizontal margin is added to the element, then there’s a chance the element may break out of its parent because that margin will be added to the width which is already 100%. This is good to know~</p>
                
                <p>I also learned about some keywords to use for width. In addition to fit-content, which I already knew about, I learned about min-content and max-content. These keywords are interesting because they are intrinsic values, which means the width is not based on the parent (extrinsic), but is based on the width of the children.</p>
                
                <p>With min-content this means the element looks for the longest single word and then makes its width be equal to that word. That longest word becomes the width of the element.</p>
                
                <p>With max-content the width of the element is equal to the width of the widest child. If a header is very long it means the width will be as long as that line is without any line-breaks. This can break outside of a parent. </p>
                
                <p>Both of these methods are interesting ways to shrink wrap content, but the most straight-forward one seems to be fit-content (just have to be sure to add the vendor prefix for Firefox!)</p>

                <p>Finished Chapter 10: Prototypes</p>
                
                <p>This is the last chapter in this course. </p>
                
                <p>I spent some time learning about prototype chains awhile back. This chapter helped me better understand what these are, especially in the context of the ‘wiring’ mental model.</p>
                
                <p>Prototypes are mostly relevant when reading property values. If a property is being written, this will occur on the object that the property is being written to, not a prototype.</p>
                
                <p>It is possible to write to an object’s prototype. This is called Prototype Pollution and for the most part should be avoided. </p>
                
                <p>Every newly created object has as its prototype a default Object Prototype which is where all those fancy methods and properties live and are accessible from. The prototype of the Object Prototype is just null. This is the end of the line for every prototype chain. </p>
                
                <p>Like properties, prototype chains are unidirectional. They flow down stream in the form of object chains. A prototype cannot access the properties of the object of which it is a prototype. </p>
                
                <p>This course was simply awesome. Probably one of the most useful courses I have taken in my coding journey. I will most likely be revisiting it over and over. </p>
                
                <p>The exercises provided were crucial for reinforcing the mental model. I am looking forward to diving into some projects to continue the reinforcement. </p>

                <p>Finished Chapter 9: Mutations</p>
                
                <p>This chapter was enlightening. I now know with surety what object mutation is and how to avoid it if necessary. </p>
                
                <p>Mutation is altering the property values of an object that is already created. </p>
                
                <p>I also learned about the const keyword and due to the mental model of wires I can grasp its usage much more clearly. The ‘const’ keyword only prevents rewiring the value a variable is connect to, but will not prevent mutation of an object. </p>
                
                <p>The concept that objects are never nested within other objects was also reinforced into my mental model. I’ve said it before, but this makes so much more sense than thinking of properties of objects and variables in terms of boxes. The ‘box’ mental model has beeb stayed and its death is most welcome.</p>
                
                <p>One thing I realized that was not mentioned in the course is how the flow of the wires of object value properties is uni-directional. It flows out from the object value that the property was ‘born’ from,  but does not flow backwards. This makes perfect sense when a property is wired to a primitive value, but can be confusing when a property is wired to another object value. </p>

                <p>This is supposed to be a day off, but I just can’t help myself here.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Just JavaScript</h3>
                <p>Today I went through Chapter 8: Properties.</p>
                
                <p>This expands on the variable mental model of wires connecting to values. Essentially properties behave like wires and just like all wires in this mental model they must be connected to a value. </p>
                
                <p>One difference between properties and variables is that variables are code which point/connect to values. Properties don’t start from code, but start from values (object values). Variables are code connecting to values; properties are values connecting to other values. </p>
                
                <p>Another aspect is that properties are not inside objects, but are simply connections that are grouped together via the object value. The object value is a sort of hub for values and the properties are what connect the values to the hub. </p>
                
                <p>The reason this is helpful is because the values of connected to properties are available to other variables and other object values. They don’t enter the object to gain access, but simply connect via their own wires to these values. </p>
                
                <p>How can something be in two boxes at the same time? This is the problem with the box mental model. The wire mental model is more accurate in explaining the behavior of variables and properties. </p>
                
                <p>I also learned about what the ‘this’ keyword does. The course doesn’t go over ‘this’ but through one of the problems I learned more about it.</p>
                
                <pre><code>//The code below would throw an error because the 'next' property is pointing to the 'president' variable's value before it has been declared. 
                
let president = {
    name: "Goofy",
    next: president
}
                
// Without the 'this' keyword this is accomplished like so:
                
let president = {
    name: "Goofy",
}

president.next = president;
                
//The same thing above can be accomplished with less code by using the 'this' keyword:
                
let president = {
    name: "Goofy",
    next: this,
}</code></pre>
                <p>When an object gets more complicated ‘this’ becomes even more useful. Encountering this problem helped me understand how ‘this’ behaves and what it replaces. I now have a better grasp on what ‘this’ is abstracting. </p>
                
                <p>I also learned about how the dot operator works in regards to accessing properties. </p>
                
                <p>If the value to the left of the ‘.’ is undefined or null an error is thrown, otherwise it moves forward.</p>
                
                <p>This makes sense because ‘undefined’ and ‘null’ are primitive values and do not posses any properties in and of themselves. </p>
                
                <p>If a property of an object hasn’t been declared, trying to access it will result in undefined. This does not mean that in doing so a property is created and wired to the value ‘undefined’. In other languages trying to access a property that doesn’t exist would result in an error. In the Universe that is JavaScript, this results in the value ‘undefined’. It’s just a law of this Universe. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Continuing with the introductory module. Continued learning about units by reading <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/">Josh’s article</a>.</p>
                
                <p>I found this article informative. It revealed a bad habit I have developed of using pixels for font sizes. This is bad for accessibility reasons. Moving forward I will be using rem units for font-sizing.</p>
                
                <p>He made an interesting case for using ems for vertical margins, which prevents excess code writing. For example: if I wanted my margins for all headers no matter what type to be 0.75x their font-size size I would have to calculate that value for every header if I were using rem units. However if I were to use ems for the margins I could just have one rule with a selector for all headers and set the margin (vertical) to 0.75em and this would take care of it  that size, then I would have to calculate that rem value.</p>
                
                <p>The article also made a very interesting case for using rem units for media queries. I am still wrapping my head around this. The example he uses to highlight the usefulness of doing this has to do with a page layout that has a vertical navigation on the left hand side. If a user bumped the default browser font size to 32px and pixels were used in the media query, then the navigation would end up taking up a larger portion of the available space, squeezing the main content. </p>
                
                <p>By using rems for the media query, when the user bumps up the font size, then the media query breakpoints would also change. In this case what would occur is the page would be following the mobile specifications and the navigation would become collapsible. This is pretty neat!</p>
                
                <p>The article was very thorough and offered some interesting workflows and I applied some of the ideas to this website and am looking forward to making these ideas a part of my workflow.</p>
                
                <p>With that said it was also emphasized that there are no hard rules and that the more projects we build the more our intuition will build in regards to determining what kinds of units to use.</p>
                
                <p>He left me with a good mental model for deciding in the form of a simple, yet powerful question: Do I want this to scale up when a user changes a browser’s default font size?</p>
                
                <p>It’s all about the mental models these days. I love em!</p>

                <p>Not a lot of time today because, y’know… life. But still getting some work in.</p>

                <h3>Learning CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>Continued with the introductory module.</p>
                
                <p>Went over colors and the 3 main keywords to use to set colors (RGB, Hexadecimal, and HSL). </p>
                
                <p>A pretty good case was made for using HSL. The argument is that HSL is much more intuitive. If a we want a color darker we adjust the light percentage, 100% being fully white and 0% fully black (default is therefore 50%). If we want a color to be less vibrant we reduce the Saturation percentage. </p>
                
                <p>One thing I don’t like about HSL is that it is mathematical and so there are aspects that are not so intuitive. Brightness (saturation) is one of these aspects. Humans don’t perceive color saturation equally across colors. Given equal saturation some colors will appear to our eyes to be more or less bright than they actually are. It’s similar with sound: low frequencies will sound quieter than higher frequencies at the same decibel level. And even this changes based on the overall decibel level. </p>
                
                <p>I am still debating which color keyword to use moving forward, but I will experiment with HSL for a time to see how I like it.</p>
                
                <p>Another thing covered has to do with units: pixels, ems, rems and percentages.</p>
                
                <p>I’ve heard many different preferences. Josh prefers rems, which I like as well as there is a single point of truth to which all rems units are relative. </p>
                
                <p>He did mention that when setting the font-size on the root element to avoid using pixels and instead use percentages. This is because when we set a font-size in pixels on the root element this will overwrite a user’s preference and I agree that this should be avoided.

                <p>I was a bit sad that vh vw and vmax were not mentioned, but they may come up later. </p>

                <h3>Learning: CSS for JavaScript Developers</h3>
                <p>I have been meaning to start this course for a long time. I am a big fan of Josh Comeau. I purchased this course almost a year ago.</p>

                <p>I got started on the first Module (module 0). This was all review so far, but is helpful for getting used to how the course is structured and for what’s to come.</p>
                
                <p>I sense so much integrity in Josh and his work and so far this course is exceeding expectations.</p>
                
                <p>Again, this guy is super inspiring for me and is an example of how I’d like to be as a coder and as a contributor to the world of coding. </p>
                
                <p>I have a lot of work to do!</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Just JavaScript</h3>
                <h4>Chapter 6: Meeting Objects and Functions</h4>
                <p>Objects and functions are both values. These are values that can be summoned (similar to primitive values), but in order for an object value and function value to be summoned it first must be created. </p>

                <p>That’s right! Objects and functions are values that we get to create! Joy!</p>
                
                <p>There are many types of objects. Dates, arrays, RegExps, Number, Math, etc.</p>
                
                <p>Objects can be created, but not destroyed. JavaScript has a garbage collection, but when this occurs cannot be guaranteed. </p>
                
                <p>Functions are objects, but with special properties. Functions possess the capabilities of objects, but not necessarily vice versa.</p>
                
                <p>When a variable is wired up to a function value, that function is created at that point in time. </p>
                
                <p>If another variable is created an wired to a function value that looks the same, it does not wire up to the same function value; a new function value is created. To wire up a variable to the same function value, then the variable must point to the function value already wired up to the other variable. (Ex: let oldVariable = function(){}; let newVariable = oldVariable;)</p>
                
                <p>In order for the code within the function body to be run, it must be called using ‘().’ When a function is called it is a <i>call expression.</i> The call expression is answered by JavaScript by running the code, resulting in whatever value is returned.</p>
                
                <p>Writing it out:</p>

                <pre><code>
let plant = function () {
    return {};
};

let tree = plant();

let flower = plant();
                </code></pre>
                
                <p>The first line created a variable called ‘plant’ and wires this up to a newly created function value.</p>
                
                <p>The second line creates a new variable called ‘tree’ and wires it up to another newly created object.</p>
                
                <p>That process looks like this: </p>
                <p>The plant variable expression results in a function value. This function value enters into the call expression, which results in an object literal expression, which results in a newly created object. </p>
                
                <p>The third line creates a new variable called ‘flower’ and runs the same process above and is wired up to another new object.</p>
                
                <p>After all this code runs there are 3 newly created values! A function value and two distinct object values. </p>

                <h4>Chapter 7: Equality of Values</h4>

                <p>There are three kinds of equality: Strict Equality (a === b), Loose Equality (a == b) and Same Value Equality (Object.is(a, b)).</p>

                <p>I have not encountered Same Value Equality yet, but this chapter started with it. </p>
                
                <p>Due to the mental models of values that has been set up throughout the course so far, Same Value Equality is easy to grasp. Where I once would have been confused (objects), I am no longer confused due to what I learned in Chapter 5. </p>
                
                <p>Strict Equality almost behaves the same, except for two special cases. </p>
                
                <p>Both cases deal with primitive special numerical cases.</p>
                
                <p>The first one has to do with NaN. With Strict Equality NaN === NaN is always false, whereas Object.is(NaN, NaN) is true. </p>
                
                <p>The second case has to do with -0 and 0. We know that -0 and 0 are individual and unique values and Same Value Equality shows this is the case:</p>
                
                <p>Object.is(-0, 0) will result in false, whereas -0 === 0 will always result in true. </p>
                
                <p>Out of these two special cases the one that will most likely be encountered is the case dealing with NaN. In order to check that a value is NaN we can do one of three things:</p>
                <p>Object.is(someVariable, NaN)</p>
                <p>Number.isNaN(someVariable)</p>
                <p>someVariable !== someVariable</p>
                
                <p>Out in the world, Strict Equality is what I will be using fo the most part, but it is super helpful to be aware fo those two special cases, especially the first. </p>
                
                <p>As for Loose Equality, I got one word: YUCK.</p>
                
                <p>I will not be using it if I can avoid it.</p>
                
                <p>Here is a useful resource which shows all the strange results of Loose Equality: <a href="https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/">JS Comparison Table</a></p>
                
                <p>This course doesn’t cover it so much and essentially warns to use with caution. </p>
                
                <p>But again, I am simply going to avoid the use altogether. </p>
                
                <p>One potential useful use case is: variableName == null</p>
                
                <p>This is like this: someVariable === null || someVariable === undefined</p>
                
                <p>But seriously? Is that really that much more code to write? I say no.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Just JavaScript</h3>
                <h4>Chapter 3: Values and Variables</h4>
                <p>A number of mental models were established within this chapter.</p>

                <p>These mental models build on the mental model of values and are related to variables.</p>
                
                <p>These mental models are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Primitive values are immutable. Object and functions are mutable.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are wires; they are associations between the variable name and the value.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are not values, but wires connecting to values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are expressions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables cannot point to other variables, only to values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variables are never ‘passed’ into functions; the value the variable points to is what is passed.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Chapter 4: Studying from the Inside</h4>
                <p>This mental model helps to isolate the focus.</p>

                <p>Any programming involves so many layers of abstraction and it can get easy to get lost in these layers. This mental model holds us within the appropriate layer. </p>
                
                <p>We don’t care about how the computer stores the memory and how all that craziness works. It’s just a distraction. What we care about are the qualities, characteristics and governing laws of JavaScript. That’s what we study. </p>
                
                <p>The foundation is: Values are not code. Most values are immutable. Variables are pointers to values, are connected to values through ‘wires.’ Expressions are questions that JavaScript can answer. These answers are in the form of variables. </p>
                
                <h4>Chapter 5: The Primitive Values</h4>
                <p>I am appreciating the order this chapter is introducing these: in order of how many values there are of each primitive data type.</p>

                <p>Undefined has one and only one flavor of its value and that is undefined.  </p>
                
                <p>Null is similar.  Null does have the typeof quirk, but other than that the difference is more human related than machine related. The machine treats them the same. In regards to human it all has to do with intention. Undefined represents unintentionally missing values, whereas null represents intentionally missing values.</p>
                
                <p>Boolean values have two flavors: true and false. There are not multiple trues, nor are there multiple false. However each flavor can have infinite numbers of wires connecting them to different variables. </p>
                
                <p>Numbers. These have so many flavors. However the amount is not limited. Numbers also behave in quirky ways due to their floating-point nature. Their precision of reduces the further we get from 0. There are also special numbers: NaN, -Infinity, and Infinity, which exist to account for special circumstances.</p>
                
                <p>BigInts allow are arbitrary-precision integers. Not fully sure what that means, but it expands JavaScript’s numerical capabilities. These can be created by simply adding an ’n’ to the end of any integer. These are important when it comes to certain areas of finance.</p>
                
                <p>Strings have many flavors as well. Every character and pattern of characters represents a unique flavor of string. Based on our Inside JavaScript mental model, all strings already exist, we do not create them, but essentially summon them. Also strings have special properties that seem similar to those of arrays (objects), but these properties don’t behave exactly the same because strings are primitive and immutable.</p>
                
                <p>Symbols. These are not touched upon very much because they involve learning more about objects and so for now it is enough to know that they are similar to keys and they allows us to store/hide information inside an object and set what parts of the code can access that information.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning: Atomic Design</h3>
                <p>Finished the book today. The last 2 chapters were useful for giving me a good idea of what it’s like to work within a team environment in the industry.</p>

                <p>They weren’t too relevant to my current situation because most of the content was targeted towards someone who is currently working within a team and is wanting to implement design systems.</p>
                
                <p>My overall takeaway from this book is an appreciation for the design systems as whole and an excitement to implement them in my own projects.</p>
                
                <p>The design system approach feels more holistic and robust and it will become a part of my foundation as I move forward.</p>
                
                <p>I do wish there was more coverage on how to actually implement a pattern library. Chapter 3 did go over this somewhat, but it didn’t get into the details, which, to be fair, were most likely beyond the scope of the book itself. </p>
                
                <p>Things I want to learn more about going forward are how template languages work with data in the form of JSON to fill in component patterns with content.</p>
                
                <p>The most valuable chapters for me are chapters 2 and 3 and I will be revisiting these as I move forward. </p>
                
                <p>Moving forward I will also be utilizing companies’ style guides for inspiration and direction. Specifically I will be diving into Google’s Material. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts and Review: Atomic Design</h3>
                <p>Reviewing what I’ve learned so far in the Atomic Design course. </p>

                <p>Atoms are the simplest pieces. These are buttons, specific kinds of text (headers, descriptions, excerpts, paragraphs), specific kinds of images (profile pics, hero images, logos)</p>
                
                <p>Molecules are combinations of atoms to form larger functional pieces such as a search input with its search button.</p>
                
                <p>Organisms bring together molecules to form even more complex functional patterns consisting of combinations of atoms, molecules and even other organisms. Example would be a header which contains a navigation organism, a logo atom and a search molecule. </p>
                
                <p>Templates are how these things are brought together within a page. Templates are generic pages with generic content. These begin to give us an idea of how all the organisms come together to form an experience.</p>
                
                <p>Pages bring in the specific content to give a finished look. This is also the stage where we can really begin to test out variations in content, using test cases to wrinkle out any issues. </p>
                
                <p>How this is actually implemented within a design system involves file/directory structure, naming conventions for the files, templating languages, such as Mustache, testing data (can be in the form of JSON), the variations of data (default/filler, best case data, variation scenarios). </p>
                
                <p>This also involves documenting, annotating and providing component lineages. Documenting is about describing what each component, usually in the form of an organism or a molecule, is for, how it is to be used, and other details that can be helpful for designers and developers. Documentation also involves providing a means to view the code related to the component in all the necessary layers (template code, rendered html, css) and to see the finished result. </p>
                
                <p>Annotating is useful and is essentially a way to put the components within the context of an actual page and giving the capability to click on a button to reveal all the documentation related to the component itself.</p>
                
                <p>Documenting the component lineage is a part of documentation as well. This provides information on what atoms, molecules, organisms make up the component, as well as what organisms contain the component. It goes both downward and upward. This is useful for testing, troubleshooting and adjusting.</p>

                <h3>Learning: Atomic Design</h3>
                <p>Finished Chapter 4. This chapter broke down a potential workflow from idea to full implantation and how that looks in a non-linear/waterfall way.</p>

                <p>It started by going over the standard way of moving a project from ida to finished product, which is linear and how this doesn’t make sense in the environment of web development. </p>
                
                <p>My take aways from it: a project can be broken into 3 sections/teams (this is another abstracted layer): UX, Visual Design, and Front-End Development. These layers are in a constant dance with one another. </p>
                
                <p>For the UX, creating lo-fi sketches is more useful than full on mockups. It’s about creating the minimum viable product to create discussion.</p>
                
                <p>Visual designers can utilize a method called the 20 second gut check, which I think is pretty cool. It involves gathering a number of other similar sites, spending 20 secs looking at each and ranking them. After this, it’s about discussing the one’s that received low marks, high marks and the ones that received both low and high marks from different people. The next phase involves creating style tiles and elemental components.</p>
                
                <p>Front-end developers can start to set up project dependencies, get the file structure down, and begin marking up basic patterns so that early design ideas can be seen in the context of the web earlier. </p>

                <h3>Learning: Atomic Design</h3>

                <p>I finished chapter 3 and started in on chapter 4 of Atomic Design</p>

                <p>Chapter 3 gave me an overview of what a Pattern Library would look like when implemented. </p>
                
                <p>Pattern libraries consist of a file structure, naming conventions, template language (this one uses Mustache), data (this uses JSON), code views, documentation and annotations, and contextual documentation.</p>
                
                <p>I can see the power of and the beauty in creating systems that take all these into account. I am looking forward to implementing them.</p>
                
                <p>For some reason I get really excited about these kinds of systems. It is probably my OCD. </p>
                
                <p>Chapter 4 went over how to create buy-in for establishing a design system, which isn’t too relevant for me right now as I am not trying to sell this to anyone at the moment. I am already bought in to utilizing this. </p>
                
                <p>However this chapter was awesome at going over what good web design needs to take into account. Aspects such as being accessible within the limitations of a human and a device, layering enhancements based on form-factors and device capabilities, being future-friendly and able to take advantage of newer technology (watches, vehicles, smart glasses, etc).</p>

                <h3>Learning: Just Javascript</h3>

                <p><a href="https://justjavascript.com/">Just JavaScript</a> is a course that I purchased not too long ago. It is created by Dan Abramov and Maggie Appleton.</p>

                <p>It teaches the fundamentals of JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>I started it today and what follows are some thoughts about the 2 chapters I went through today.</p>
                
                <p>So far I am enjoying it very much.</p>

                <h4>Chapter One</h4>

                <p>This chapter is all about revealing the power of mental models. They exist whether we are aware of them or not. Becoming aware of them is important and foundational in being the best coder we can be.</p>

                <p>The chapter wraps mental models into the reality of the two speeds at which we think: fast and slow.</p>
                
                <p>Fast thinking involves patterned habitual, thinking and requires little energy. </p>
                
                <p>Slow thinking involves the ability to plan out, re- and de-structure, and take apart a process piece by piece to understand what is happening in order to make what we want to happen happen.</p>
                
                <p>Having accurate mental models is important for both fast thinking and slow thinking.</p>
                
                <p>Accurate mental models lead to less bugs and more efficient debugging. </p>
                
                <p>It is often the case that bugs arise when our fast thinking is based on inaccurate mental models. These bugs require us to enter into slow thinking mode. </p>
                
                <p>When we enter the more laborious slow thinking mode we can, if we are attentive, expose the flaws in our mental models as our mental model is what we are using to step through the process piece by piece. </p>
                
                <p>With the right mentality, bugs become opportunities for growth.</p>
                
                <h4>Chapter Two</h4>

                <p>This chapter was about values. </p>

                <p>The mental model of this chapter is: Values are not code.</p>
                
                <p>The concept that values are separate from code was one I haven’t encountered, but I think it is an important one. Our code is what moves values around and utilizes values. </p>
                
                <p>Values however are not dependent upon code. They exist whether there is code or not. They are the raw material waiting to be used. Like granite. It is there whether or not it is “programmed” into being a counter top. </p>
                
                <p>The elucidation of expressions was helpful as well. Expressions are questions that JavaScript can answer and the answer will always be in the form of a value. </p>
                
                <p>Values themselves come in 9 and only 9 types. There are two broad categories of values: primitive values and then objects and functions. It was made clear that functions are essentially types of objects, but they are special enough to warrant a pseudo-separation from objects. </p>
                
                <p>Primitive values are the most raw material and consist of numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbols, and bigints.</p>
                
                <p>Then there are objects and functions which are values, but can be interacted with uniquely using code. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Spent some time writing some more about the relationships of content, design and structure. I am finding this to be extremely helpful and grounding. All the learning that is to come will be rooted in better, more fertile soil due to having a better understanding of the context web design and development occurs within.</p>

                <p>I am coming to learn that I do have certain opinions. For instance, content itself needs to be the boss. Mostly. There is a lot of interplay between content, design, and structure, and yet there is also a main current that flows mostly in a certain direction. </p>
                
                <p>Design and structure should, for the most part be following the lead of content. Editing of content should be occurring outside of what colors and type it will be using and where and how it will be displayed. </p>
                
                <p>With that said, I know there are some books that had to be edited because the book itself needed to be shorter. In these cases structure is an editing factor on the content. But perhaps the structural needs only highlighted missed opportunities for creating more impactful content, forcing hard questions to be asked and darlings to be killed. In this sense structure didn’t necessarily do the editing, but rather created the impetus for improved editing.</p>
                
                <p>In this manner there is always bi-directional flow occurring, but for the most part content is king (or queen) and the flow is from content to design and structure.</p>
                
                <p>Content has a purpose and that purpose informs the style of voice that conveys the words. The purpose and voice are crucial factors when it comes to making design decisions. The color, textures, and typography need to support the purpose and voice of the content. There is simply no reason for this to have any back flow.</p>
                
                <p>Artistically, perhaps it could be fun to start with the limitation of using the color blue and letting that color’s psychological implications generate content. But for the most part this is not the case. </p>
                
                <p>When it comes to structure it gets interesting. There is an obvious connection between content and HTML semantic structure. The structure of the HTML will follow the structure of the content. </p>
                
                <p>But there are other structural aspects that aren’t necessarily dependent on the content itself, but rather are there to make sure that the content is flexibly visible and accessible. This involves external and internal layers.</p>
                
                <p>Externally, this means that the user is able to come into contact with the content. This contact must be able to occur within the majority of circumstances a user may find themselves. These circumstances are inherent to the user (blindness, deafness, motor impairment, etc.) and inherent to the device (screen sizes, interface differences, etc).</p>
                
                <p>Internally, this means that designers, developers and project managers are able to communicate with one another using a shared language that creates internal cohesion. This in turn would greatly benefit the stakeholders for what should be obvious reasons.  </p>
                
                <p>The flow between these internal and external structural layers is very much a bi-directional flow. Externally, users encountering the content will have positive and negative experiences. Negative experiences need to be eliminated and positive experiences need to be supported and enhanced.</p>
                
                <p>There is a lot of testing in this and when the factors involved in decreasing negative experiences and increasing positive experiences are discovered, there needs to be efficient ways to implement those discoveries. This is where internal structure in the form of design systems become crucial.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning </h3>
                <p>Started Chapter 3 of Atomic Design. This chapter is getting into how to actually implement a Pattern Library system. The author has created his own system which can be used called <a href="https://patternlab.io/" target="_blank">Pattern Lab</a>.</p>

                <p>For now I am more interested is how this system is implemented than in using Pattern Lab itself.</p>
                
                <p>I enjoyed learning about the file structure and how the Mustache template library is used to implement the mental model of atoms, molecules and organisms. </p>
                
                <p>Learned about the importance of having layers of test data in the process. There is the the default data such as images that are essentially block of color with the dimension indicated for the image, then there is the test data which is a specific test instance with an actual image and actual text (not lorem ipsum). Then, to take a step further it is about creating other test cases that reveal the extremes of the ;layout, which really helps to weed out issues. </p>
                
                <p>The takeaways from today: project file structure, use of templating language, use of JSON for data test cases and how to implement layers of data throughout the process. I am really looking forward to implementing this in practice. </p>
                
                <p>I will finish this chapter tomorrow and perhaps even chapter 4.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Once I get my “system” of learning up and running fully Sunday’s will usually be my day off, fully. However today I have the desire to keep on keeping’ on for now. It doesn’t seem like work. It brings me joy.</p>

                <p>Today I further refined the distillations from yesterday. The biggest thing that fell into place for me is how modular design is linked to and informs the visual design (thinking about the idea that is Elemental Components). </p>
                
                <p>My rough diagram of how content gets styled and structured is becoming more delineated. There is a definite flow of well structured content into a design system. Now, I do realized there is always a sort of ebb and flow between all the processes in regards to structuring and styling content. It’s one of those Chicken and the Egg paradigms. </p>
                
                <p>Well-structured content  > Design System > Visual Design and Modular Design > Responsive layout and structure > Pattern Libraries. </p>
                
                <p>It seems to feed down into less abstraction, which then feeds back up through the more abstract layers. There is a constant motion between these  poles, moving from general to specific and back again. </p>

                <h3>Coding Journal Project Setup</h3>
                <p>This coding journal is meant to be a sort of daily (except Sundays, usually) place where I keep tabs on what the hell I am doing.</p>

                <p>This will also be a perfect means for me to practice design systems to a certain extent.</p>
                
                <p>I have a website setup at <a href="https://christhe.dev/" target="_blank">ChrisThe.Dev</a> and this journal is going to be the main content of it for now.</p>
                
                <p>I got this set up on the server and got some practice with pulling from GitHub as I am bouncing between a couple computers right now. This is good practice. </p>
                
                <h3>Learning </h3>
                <p>Today I went through chapter 2 of Atomic Design. I am really loving this book so far. It is also confirming of a lot of the thoughts I have been having lately. Many times I would see words and phrases used in the book that I myself have used. It’s just nice to see that.</p>

                <p>Here’s a distillation of chapter 2:</p>
                
                <p>Loving the mental model of using chemistry. This not only makes sense to me, but resonates with me in regards to involving models that represent natural phenomenon that are already well-established. This is called leverage and leverage is one of the core reasons why programming exists in the first place. Plus, I love chemistry. </p>
                
                <p>We have atoms, molecules, and organisms. These build upon each other logically. They also help inform one another.</p>
                
                <p>As we move up in complexity we start to enter into context. Atoms are outside of context, but combine to form context in the form of molecules, which combine to form a more solid context in the form of organisms. </p>
                
                <p>Once we move beyond organisms we then leave behind the chemistry model and enter into the context of the web itself. It starts with templates which is page dependent, but content independent and then it moves to pages which are content dependent.</p>
                
                <p>This is a progression from general to specific. Context evolves as the process moves forward and as we reach the most specific point we get to see how the atoms, molecules and organisms are serving there purpose. If something isn’t working we have the benefit of being able to make an informed decision regarding the level that the issue needs to be addressed. </p>
                
                <p>I am excited to learn more of this. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>No learning today; this was a day of consolidating what I learned yesterday when reading the first chapter of Atomic Design. I created a distillation of the learnings.</p>

                <p>This allowed me to get a better grip on how design systems work and how there are decreasing layers of abstraction.</p>
                
                <p>I think I am going to make Saturdays a consolidation day. A day of refining and revisiting the week’s learnings and potentially the day where I create a legitimate article is either published or at the point of being ready to publish. </p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <p>I spent a lot of time over the last few days creating a plan for how I will pursue my learning. </p>

                <p>I am learning that there is only so much planning that can be done and that I have reached that limit. It is an organic process of checking and changing. Make the plan, then do because the doing reveals a lot of information that will help further flesh out the plan and, most importantly, tie it to reality.</p>
                
                <p>The plan, for now, is structured into Learning, Building, Networking and Contributing, and Writing. </p>
                
                <p>I have learned that the Writing component is built into Learning and Building via the creation of writings.</p>
                
                <p>The writing occurs in stages. Most of the writing is for my own understanding. The writing is sloppy at first, just writing whatever comes to mind, but this gives me material to structure and potentially craft into an article. I make the block of stone and then I carve out David… at least that’s the dream haha!</p>
                
                <p>Writing is also built into Networking and Contributing via sharing the writings that are created, as well as sharing the knowledge gained through writing, which helps with my understanding. </p>
                
                <p>The purpose of writing is to concretize my understanding. It is the same concept as Rubber Duck Debugging. </p>

                <h3>Learnings</h3>
                <p>Today I started reading Atomic Design by Brad Frost. I read the first chapter and learned of the importance of design systems. I also learned about the limitations of using design apps such as Photoshop when it comes to building websites. I find that making this limitation explicit actually makes these apps more useful. </p>

                <p>I spent a good deal of time writing about what I learned. Trying to figure out a better way to distill this. The distilling is challenging for me currently, but the challenge is fun. It forces me to think about some logical flow. Plus it is the distilled writings that I will ultimately be able to offer to others as a form of contribution.</p>
